# Container Security Policy

## Base Image Security

- Use official minimal base images (Alpine-based where possible)
- Pin exact image versions with SHA256 digests
- Regular scanning of base images for vulnerabilities
- Automatic updates for critical security patches

## Container Hardening

- Run containers as non-root users
- Use read-only root filesystems where possible
- Drop all Linux capabilities except those required
- Use seccomp profiles to restrict system calls
- Set resource limits for all containers

## Runtime Security

- Enable user namespace isolation
- Implement network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Use admission controllers for policy enforcement
- Regular vulnerability scanning of deployed containers
- Implement least privilege principle for all services
