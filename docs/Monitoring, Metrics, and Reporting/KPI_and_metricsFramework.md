## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and metrics framework for measuring, analyzing, and improving the performance of the zkVote protocol. It defines the critical metrics across all operational areas, providing a comprehensive approach to tracking progress toward strategic objectives and making data-driven decisions.

### 1.2 Scope

This framework encompasses metrics for all aspects of zkVote:

- Product performance and adoption
- Technical implementation and efficiency
- Business growth and sustainability
- User engagement and community health
- Security and privacy effectiveness
- Governance outcome measurement
- Operational excellence

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

The zkVote metrics framework follows these core principles:

1. **Alignment with Mission**: All metrics connect directly to our mission of enabling privacy-preserving governance
2. **Balanced Perspective**: Metrics span technical, business, and community dimensions
3. **Actionability**: Each metric provides insights that can drive specific actions
4. **Privacy Preservation**: Measurement methods respect user privacy
5. **Leading Indicators**: Emphasis on metrics that predict future success, not just record past performance
6. **Continuous Evolution**: Regular review and refinement of metrics as the protocol evolves

## 2. Framework Overview

### 2.1 Metrics Hierarchy

The zkVote metrics framework is organized in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Top-level metrics directly tied to strategic objectives
2. **Performance Metrics**: Supporting metrics that contribute to KPIs
3. **Operational Metrics**: Day-to-day metrics that track operational activities

```
Strategic Objectives
        ↓
    KPIs (10-15)
        ↓
Performance Metrics (30-40)
        ↓
Operational Metrics (100+)
```

### 2.2 Core KPI Categories

### 13.2 Metric Calculation Methodologies

_Detailed formulas and calculation methodologies for complex metrics are maintained in the zkVote Analytics Handbook (ZKV-ANALYTICS-2025-001) and referenced here for brevity._

#### 13.2.1 Key Composite Metrics

| Composite Metric            | Component Metrics                                               | Weighting Method                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Adoption Index**  | Feature usage rates weighted by strategic importance            | Weighted average with quarterly weight recalibration |
| **Product Stability Score** | Uptime, error rates, performance metrics                        | Geometric mean with minimum thresholds               |
| **Customer Health Score**   | Usage metrics, support interactions, renewal indicators         | Machine learning model with continuous validation    |
| **Privacy Guarantee Score** | Technical privacy measures, external evaluations, audit results | Weighted average with security expert calibration    |
| **Decision Quality Score**  | Process adherence, outcome alignment, stakeholder satisfaction  | Multi-factor framework with quarterly validation     |

#### 13.2.2 Statistical Methodologies

For advanced metric analysis, the framework employs the following statistical approaches:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score and DBSCAN algorithms for identifying metric outliers
- **Trend Analysis**: ARIMA and exponential smoothing for time-series forecasting
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson and Spearman correlation with significance testing
- **Segmentation Analysis**: K-means clustering and cohort analysis techniques
- **Impact Analysis**: Causal inference methods including DiD and synthetic controls
