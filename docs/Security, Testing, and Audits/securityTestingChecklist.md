| Vulnerability             | Testing Pattern                                      | Example                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancy                | Check for external calls followed by state changes   | `function withdraw() { msg.sender.call{value: balance}(""); balance = 0; }`                                |
| Access Control            | Check for missing or incorrect access controls       | `function changeOwner(address newOwner) public { owner = newOwner; }`                                      |
| Integer Overflow          | Test arithmetic operations with boundary values      | `uint8 value = 255; value++;`                                                                              |
| Unchecked Return Values   | Check for call/send/transfer without checking return | `destination.call{value: amount}("");`                                                                     |
| Front-Running             | Examine functions where order matters                | `function claimReward(uint256 rewardId) public { require(!claimed[rewardId]); claimed[rewardId] = true; }` |
| Timestamp Dependence      | Check for critical reliance on block.timestamp       | `require(block.timestamp > deadline);`                                                                     |
| Compiler Optimization     | Check for dangerous optimization settings            | `pragma solidity ^0.8.0; /* with aggressive IR optimization */`                                            |
