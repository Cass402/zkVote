This checklist covers security testing for all components of the zkVote protocol, including:

- Core voting protocol smart contracts
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification systems
- Delegation protocol components
- Cross-chain bridge and aggregation mechanisms

### 12.3 Common Vulnerability Patterns

#### 12.3.1 Smart Contract Vulnerability Patterns

| Vulnerability           | Testing Pattern                                      | Example                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancy              | Check for external calls followed by state changes   | `function withdraw() { msg.sender.call{value: balance}(""); balance = 0; }`                                |
| Access Control          | Check for missing or incorrect access controls       | `function changeOwner(address newOwner) public { owner = newOwner; }`                                      |
| Integer Overflow        | Test arithmetic operations with boundary values      | `uint8 value = 255; value++;`                                                                              |
| Unchecked Return Values | Check for call/send/transfer without checking return | `destination.call{value: amount}("");`                                                                     |
| Front-Running           | Examine functions where order matters                | `function claimReward(uint256 rewardId) public { require(!claimed[rewardId]); claimed[rewardId] = true; }` |
| Timestamp Dependence    | Check for critical reliance on block.timestamp       | `require(block.timestamp > deadline);`                                                                     |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Validator Collusion  | Test threshold security                           | 5-of-8 multisig where 5 validators could collude     |
