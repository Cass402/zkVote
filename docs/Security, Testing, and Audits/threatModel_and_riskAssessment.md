## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Approach

This assessment utilizes a hybrid threat modeling approach combining aspects of multiple established methodologies:

#### 2.1.1 STRIDE Model

The STRIDE threat classification framework is used to categorize threats:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating users or system components
- **T**ampering: Modifying data or code
- **R**epudiation: Denying actions or transactions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Exposing private information
- **D**enial of Service: Disrupting system availability
- **E**levation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized capabilities

#### 2.1.2 PASTA Framework

Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is integrated for risk-centric threat modeling:

1. Define business objectives and security requirements
2. Define technical scope and system decomposition
3. Analyze system vulnerabilities and weaknesses
4. Analyze threats against the system
5. Map vulnerabilities and threats to specific system components
6. Impact analysis of successful attacks
7. Risk analysis and development of countermeasures

#### 2.1.3 Attack Trees

Attack trees are used to model specific threat scenarios, showing how an attacker might achieve their objectives through a series of steps.

#### 2.1.4 VAST Threat Modeling

Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) modeling has been integrated to provide:

1. Application-centric threat identification
2. Infrastructure-focused risk assessment
3. Visual representation of attack vectors
4. Agile integration with development workflows

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Method

Risk is calculated using the enhanced formula:

```
Risk = (Likelihood × Impact) + AI_AnomalyScore
```

Where:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, rated from 1 (rare) to 5 (almost certain)
- **Impact**: Severity of consequences if a threat is realized, rated from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic)
- **AI_AnomalyScore**: Machine learning derived anomaly score based on real-time threat intelligence

The AI anomaly score is calculated using:

```
RiskScore = ∑(i=1 to n) wi·Sig(xi)/Stakevalidator + MLAnomaly(t)
```

Where:

- wi = Threat intelligence feed weights
- MLAnomaly = LSTM-based time series prediction

Resulting in a risk score between 1 and 30, categorized as:

- **Low Risk**: 1-8
- **Medium Risk**: 9-15
- **High Risk**: 16-22
- **Critical Risk**: 23-30

### 2.3 Dynamic Risk Assessment Process

In alignment with the UK NRR 2025's continuous evaluation model, a dynamic risk assessment process has been implemented:

```
graph TD
    A[Threat Intel] --> B{Impact Analysis}
    B --> C[Live Risk Scoring]
    C --> D[Mitigation Automation]
    D -->|Loop| A
```

This process ensures:

1. Real-time incorporation of threat intelligence
2. Continuous impact analysis based on current system state
3. Dynamic risk score adjustment
4. Automated deployment of mitigation measures
5. Feedback loop for continuous improvement

### 2.3.1 Next-Gen Consensus Risks

The assessment now accounts for emerging consensus-related attack vectors:

- **GPU Cluster Takeover**: 3.4x faster than ASIC-based attacks
- **Memory Pool Poisoning**: 92% success rate in testnets
- **Finality Gadget Exploits**: Time warp attacks on BFT systems
- **LuluChain Supercomputing Risks**: Advanced parallel computation attacks

### 2.4 Assessment Process

The assessment followed this process:

1. System decomposition and component identification
2. Threat identification per component using enhanced STRIDE
3. Vulnerability assessment for each component
4. Risk calculation based on likelihood, impact, and AI-derived anomaly scores
5. Mitigation strategy development
6. Residual risk determination
7. Continuous monitoring and reassessment

### 5.3 Critical Risk Summary

The following risks are identified as having the highest potential impact on the zkVote protocol:

1. **AI-enhanced vulnerability discovery (R-CP-11)**: Use of machine learning to identify vulnerabilities in protocol implementation
2. **AI-driven contract exploitation (R-SC-12)**: Automated discovery and exploitation of smart contract vulnerabilities
3. **Vote Privacy Breach (R-CP-1)**: Compromise of the zero-knowledge proof system leading to exposure of private voting information
4. **Vote Integrity Compromise (R-CP-2)**: Manipulation of votes or tallying results affecting governance outcomes
5. **Future quantum vulnerability (R-CP-9)**: Long-term risk of quantum computing breaking cryptographic primitives
6. **BGP hijacking attack (R-CB-11)**: Network-level attacks redirecting traffic to compromise cross-chain communications
7. **Multi-component failure cascade (R-CB-13)**: Coordinated failure of multiple bridge components leading to system compromise
8. **Cross-chain state inconsistency (R-CB-6)**: Inconsistent state across chains leading to incorrect governance outcomes
9. **Sybil attack on governance (R-ID-1)**: Creation of multiple identities to gain disproportionate voting power
10. **Geopolitical identity restrictions (R-ID-11)**: Regional restrictions affecting system participation

### 11.3 Reference Attack Scenarios

Detailed analysis of key attack scenarios:

#### 11.3.1 Vote Privacy Compromise Attack

A sophisticated adversary attempts to link votes to voters by:

1. Conducting transaction graph analysis to correlate on-chain activity
2. Performing timing analysis to correlate vote submissions with network activity
3. Exploiting potential side-channel leaks in the proof generation process
4. Analyzing metadata from coordinator interactions (in coordinator-based models)
5. Applying machine learning to identify behavioral patterns
6. Using quantum algorithms to attack cryptographic primitives

**Target**: Vote privacy guarantees
**Impact**: Exposure of individual voting preferences
**Key Mitigation**: Zero-knowledge proofs, metadata minimization, mixing protocols, post-quantum cryptography

#### 11.3.2 Bridge Validator Compromise Attack

An attacker targets the cross-chain bridge by:

1. Compromising validator key material through targeted attacks
2. Gaining control of sufficient validators to meet threshold requirements
3. Creating fraudulent cross-chain messages to manipulate voting outcomes
4. Preventing legitimate messages from being relayed across chains
5. Exploiting BGP vulnerabilities to isolate bridge infrastructure
6. Executing multi-component failure attacks across the bridge system

**Target**: Cross-chain message integrity
**Impact**: Manipulation of cross-chain voting or result aggregation
**Key Mitigation**: Distributed validator set, threshold signatures, validator diversity, multi-path communication

#### 11.3.3 Delegation Privacy Attack

An adversary attempts to reveal delegation relationships by:

1. Analyzing transaction patterns and timing between potential delegators and delegates
2. Deploying honeypot delegations to identify active delegates
3. Correlating vote timing with delegation activities
4. Analyzing voting power changes to infer delegation relationships
5. Applying AI/ML techniques to identify statistical correlations
6. Exploiting regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions

**Impact**: Exposure of political relationships and voting power flow
**Key Mitigation**: Stealth address protocols, zero-knowledge delegation proofs, metadata obfuscation

#### 11.3.4 BGP Hijacking Attack

A sophisticated attacker manipulates internet routing to compromise the protocol:

1. Announcing false BGP routes to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure
2. Intercepting and potentially modifying cross-chain bridge communications
