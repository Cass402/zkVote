## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive threat model and risk assessment for the zkVote platform. It identifies potential security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with the protocol's design and implementation. The assessment evaluates the potential impact of identified threats and proposes mitigation strategies to reduce the associated risks to acceptable levels.

### 1.2 Scope

This threat model and risk assessment covers:

- Core voting protocol components
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification systems

- Cross-chain bridging and aggregation functions
- Identity and eligibility verification systems
- Smart contract implementations
- Protocol governance mechanisms

The assessment encompasses both technical and operational aspects, focusing on threats to:

- Privacy guarantees
- Vote integrity
- System availability
- Governance security
- Cross-chain operations

### 1.3 Audience

This document is intended for:

- Security engineers and auditors

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Approach

This assessment utilizes a hybrid threat modeling approach combining aspects of multiple established methodologies:

#### 2.1.1 STRIDE Model

The STRIDE threat classification framework is used to categorize threats:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating users or system components
- **T**ampering: Modifying data or code
- **R**epudiation: Denying actions or transactions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Exposing private information
- **D**enial of Service: Disrupting system availability
- **E**levation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized capabilities

#### 2.1.2 PASTA Framework

Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is integrated for risk-centric threat modeling:

1. Define business objectives and security requirements
2. Define technical scope and system decomposition
3. Analyze system vulnerabilities and weaknesses
4. Analyze threats against the system
5. Map vulnerabilities and threats to specific system components
6. Impact analysis of successful attacks
7. Risk analysis and development of countermeasures

#### 2.1.3 Attack Trees

Attack trees are used to model specific threat scenarios, showing how an attacker might achieve their objectives through a series of steps.

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Method

Risk is calculated using the following formula:

```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

Where:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, rated from 1 (rare) to 5 (almost certain)
- **Impact**: Severity of consequences if a threat is realized, rated from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic)

Resulting in a risk score between 1 and 25, categorized as:

- **Low Risk**: 1-6
- **Medium Risk**: 7-12
- **High Risk**: 13-18
- **Critical Risk**: 19-25

### 2.3 Assessment Process

The assessment followed this process:

1. System decomposition and component identification
2. Threat identification per component using STRIDE
3. Vulnerability assessment for each component
4. Risk calculation based on likelihood and impact
5. Mitigation strategy development
6. Residual risk determination

### 5.3 Critical Risk Summary

The following risks are identified as having the highest potential impact on the zkVote protocol:

1. **Vote Privacy Breach (R-CP-1)**: Compromise of the zero-knowledge proof system leading to exposure of private voting information
2. **Vote Integrity Compromise (R-CP-2)**: Manipulation of votes or tallying results affecting governance outcomes
3. **Bridge Validator Compromise (R-CB-1)**: Malicious control of bridge validators enabling cross-chain attacks
4. **Smart Contract Logic Errors (R-SC-5)**: Implementation bugs leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities
5. **Cross-Chain State Inconsistency (R-CB-6)**: Inconsistent state across chains leading to incorrect governance outcomes

6. **Sybil Attack on Governance (R-ID-1)**: Creation of multiple identities to gain disproportionate voting power

**Target**: Cross-chain message integrity
**Impact**: Manipulation of cross-chain voting or result aggregation
**Key Mitigation**: Distributed validator set, threshold signatures, validator diversity

#### 10.3.3 Delegation Privacy Attack

An adversary attempts to reveal delegation relationships by:

1. Analyzing transaction patterns and timing between potential delegators and delegates
2. Deploying honeypot delegations to identify active delegates
3. Correlating vote timing with delegation activities
4. Analyzing voting power changes to infer delegation relationships
