5. **Simplicity**: Fee structures are straightforward and easy to understand
6. **Flexibility**: Options available to accommodate different usage patterns
7. **Sustainability**: Generates sufficient revenue to sustain continued development
8. **Fairness**: Similar customers are charged similar fees for similar usage

### 2.2 Fee Model Objectives

The fee model is designed to achieve the following objectives:

1. Generate sustainable revenue to fund ongoing protocol development
2. Encourage adoption across different market segments
3. Align costs with value received
4. Provide flexibility for different implementation scenarios
5. Incentivize long-term commitments
6. Support ecosystem growth through fair pricing
7. Enable strategic partnerships through flexible arrangements
