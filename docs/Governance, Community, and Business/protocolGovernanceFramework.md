## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Protocol Governance Framework defines how decisions are made regarding the zkVote protocol in the absence of a governance token. It establishes transparent, fair, and effective mechanisms for protocol governance that balance the interests of all stakeholders while ensuring the long-term sustainability and technical excellence of zkVote.

### 1.2 Scope

This framework covers:

- Governance philosophy and guiding principles
- Participant roles and responsibilities
- Decision-making processes and mechanisms
- Proposal lifecycle management
- Implementation and execution procedures
- Dispute resolution
- Framework amendment procedures

### 1.3 Governance Without a Token

zkVote has deliberately chosen not to implement a governance token to:

1. **Avoid Plutocracy**: Prevent concentration of power based on financial resources
2. **Reduce Speculation**: Separate protocol governance from speculative market activities
3. **Focus on Merit**: Base influence on contributions and expertise rather than token holdings
4. **Minimize Conflicts**: Avoid conflicts between token value maximization and protocol integrity
5. **Enhance Inclusivity**: Lower barriers to governance participation

Instead, zkVote implements a multi-stakeholder governance system based on expertise, contribution, and balanced representation to ensure decisions serve the best interests of the protocol and its users.

### 1.4 Core Governance Values

zkVote's governance is guided by the following core values:

1. **Technical Excellence**: Prioritizing the security, privacy, and effectiveness of the protocol
2. **Inclusive Participation**: Enabling diverse stakeholder input while preventing capture
3. **Transparent Process**: Ensuring governance activities are visible and understandable
4. **Pragmatic Progress**: Balancing thorough deliberation with timely decision-making
5. **Long-term Sustainability**: Favoring decisions that ensure protocol longevity over short-term gains

## 2. Governance Philosophy and Principles

### 2.1 Governance Philosophy

zkVote's governance philosophy centers on creating a system that:

1. **Balances Stakeholder Interests**: Considers the needs of all ecosystem participants
2. **Prioritizes Expertise**: Values technical and domain knowledge in decision-making
3. **Ensures Accountability**: Creates clear responsibilities and feedback mechanisms
4. **Evolves Progressively**: Transitions gradually from more centralized to more decentralized governance
5. **Preserves Core Values**: Maintains unwavering commitment to privacy and security principles

### 2.2 Guiding Principles

All governance activities adhere to the following principles:

#### 2.2.1 Merit and Contribution

- Influence is earned through meaningful contributions to the protocol
- Technical expertise is recognized and valued in decision-making
- Consistent participation builds governance reputation

#### 2.2.2 Inclusivity and Representation

- Multiple stakeholder groups have formal representation
- Geographic and demographic diversity is actively sought
- Barriers to participation are minimized

#### 2.2.3 Transparency and Accessibility

- Decision-making processes are transparent and documented
- Reasoning behind decisions is clearly articulated
- Governance information is accessible to all stakeholders

#### 2.2.4 Checks and Balances

- No single group can unilaterally control critical decisions
- Multiple stakeholder groups must consent for major changes
- Veto powers are limited and regulated

#### 2.2.5 Efficiency and Pragmatism

- Governance overhead is minimized
- Decision processes are tiered by impact
- Routine decisions use streamlined processes

#### 2.2.6 Security and Resilience

- Protocol security takes precedence over other considerations
- Emergency response mechanisms exist for critical situations
- Governance itself is resistant to attacks and manipulation

In place of token-based governance, zkVote implements a reputation system:

#### 3.3.1 Reputation Scoring

Reputation is earned through:

| Activity                        | Reputation Points                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Code contribution (accepted PR) | 3-10 based on impact                  |
| Documentation contribution      | 1-5 based on impact                   |
| Technical review                | 1-3 based on depth                    |
| Bug reporting                   | 1-10 based on severity                |
| Community support               | 1-3 based on impact                   |
| Governance participation        | 1-2 per constructive proposal comment |
| Integration partner status      | 5-15 based on usage                   |

#### 3.3.2 Reputation Levels

| Level                   | Points Required | Governance Rights                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Observer                | 0               | Discussion participation                       |
| Contributor             | 5               | Proposal comments, Community Assembly voting   |
| Established Contributor | 20              | Proposal submission, working group eligibility |
| Core Contributor        | 50              | Eligibility for representative positions       |
| Steward                 | 100             | Eligibility for council positions              |

#### 3.3.3 Reputation Decay

To ensure continued engagement:

- Reputation points decay at 10% per quarter of inactivity
- Negative actions (code breaking, norm violations) can result in reputation penalties
- Historical contributions are preserved in a reputation "floor" (25% of max achieved)

## 4. Decision-Making Framework

### 4.1 Decision-Making Principles

zkVote's governance decisions follow these principles:

1. **Appropriate Authority**: Decisions are made at the lowest level possible by those with relevant expertise
2. **Tiered Approach**: Decision processes scale with impact and significance
3. **Consensus Priority**: Seeking consensus before resorting to voting mechanisms
4. **Transparency**: Decision rationales documented and publicly available
5. **Informed Decisions**: Based on data, expertise, and thorough discussion

### 4.2 Decision-Making Methods

#### 4.2.1 Consensus-Seeking

**Process**:

1. Proposal presented and discussed
2. Issues and concerns identified and addressed
3. Proposal refined based on feedback
4. Consensus sought through explicit agreement
5. If consensus not reached, fallback to appropriate voting method

**When Used**: Primary decision method for all governance bodies

#### 4.2.2 Qualified Majority Voting

**Process**:

1. Formal vote called after consensus attempts
2. Each eligible participant votes: Approve, Reject, or Abstain
3. Decision requires meeting specific threshold (typically supermajority)

**When Used**: Fallback when consensus cannot be reached for significant decisions

#### 4.2.3 Reputation-Weighted Voting

**Process**:

1. Open voting period for eligible participants
2. Votes weighted by reputation score
3. Quadratic weighting applied to prevent outsized influence
4. Results tabulated and decision determined by simple or specified majority

**When Used**: Community Assembly decisions, advisory polls

#### 4.2.4 Executive Decision

**Process**:

1. Authorized decision-maker makes unilateral decision
2. Decision documented with rationale
3. Subject to post-decision review

**When Used**: Operational decisions, emergency situations

### 4.3 Decision Rights Matrix

| Decision Type             | TSC        | Protocol Council | Improvement Process Team | Security Council | Community Assembly | Core Team  |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
