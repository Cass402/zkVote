## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Description

zkVote is a next-generation protocol that enables anonymous yet verifiable voting. It offers configurable privacy, supports cross-chain operations, and includes features such as private delegation and customizable result revelation.

### 2.2 Context and Background

Traditional blockchain governance exposes voting records publicly, increasing risks like coercion and vote buying. While existing solutions (Semaphore, MACI, Cicada, Shutter Network) address some issues, they leave gaps in delegation privacy, cross-chain compatibility, and integration simplicity.

### 2.3 System Components

- **Core Protocol Layer**
- **Integration Layer**
- **Configuration Layer**
- **Application Layer**

### 2.4 User Classes and Characteristics

- **Voters:** Individuals with privacy requirements.
- **Delegates:** Entities representing others while keeping delegation private.
- **Vote Administrators:** Organizations configuring and deploying voting instances.
- **Protocol Developers:** Technical users handling system integration.
- **Auditors:** Third parties ensuring vote process integrity.
