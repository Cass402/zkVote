# zkVote Data Availability \& Storage Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of zkVote's multi-layered data availability and storage architecture, designed to ensure secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage of governance data. By combining a three-tier storage approach with advanced data availability solutions and time-based access controls, zkVote creates a robust foundation for decentralized governance that balances security, privacy, and usability.

## Introduction

The zkVote protocol requires a specialized storage architecture that maintains data integrity and availability while preserving voter privacy and supporting cross-chain operations. Traditional blockchain storage approaches face significant challenges in scaling, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency when applied to governance data. This document outlines zkVote's innovative approach to addressing these challenges through a multi-layered storage solution.

The architecture leverages three complementary layers-core blockchain storage, intermediate private blockchain (TBchain), and extended decentralized storage-combined with specialized data availability solutions and time-based access controls. This design enables zkVote to maintain cryptographic verification on-chain while delegating larger data storage requirements to specialized layers, achieving both security and scalability.

By integrating cutting-edge solutions like EigenDA and Celestia alongside established technologies like IPFS, the zkVote storage architecture delivers a configurable framework that governance applications can adapt to their specific requirements for security, privacy, cost efficiency, and throughput.

## Three-tier Storage Implementation

### Architecture Overview

zkVote implements a sophisticated three-tier storage architecture to address the inherent limitations of blockchain storage while maintaining security, privacy, and data integrity. This approach distributes governance data across multiple layers based on privacy requirements, access patterns, and verification needs[^9][^12].

The three tiers in the zkVote storage architecture are:

1. **Core Layer** - On-chain storage for critical protocol states, vote commitments, nullifiers, and verification data. This layer leverages the security of the underlying blockchain while minimizing storage requirements.
2. **TBchain Layer** - A private blockchain layer that stores privacy-sensitive governance data with controlled access. This intermediate layer implements specialized consensus mechanisms optimized for governance operations.
3. **Extended Storage Layer** - Off-chain decentralized storage for large datasets, vote histories, and supporting documentation using IPFS with specialized pinning services.

This architecture enables zkVote to maintain cryptographic verification on-chain while delegating larger data storage requirements to specialized layers, achieving both security and scalability[^9].

### TBchain Integration

TBchain provides a specialized private blockchain layer optimized for governance data with enhanced privacy protections. The zkVote implementation of TBchain serves as an intermediate layer between the public blockchain and extended storage solutions[^12].

TBchain implements specialized block structures optimized for governance data:

```
TBchainBlock {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Transaction[],
    governanceData: {
        proposalMerkleRoot: bytes32,
        votesMerkleRoot: bytes32,
        delegationMerkleRoot: bytes32,
        metadataIPFSReference: bytes32
    },
    accessControl: {
        permissionBitmap: uint256,
        timeConstraints: TimeConstraint[],
        roleMerkleRoot: bytes32
    },
    crossChainReferences: ChainReference[]
}
```

TBchain nodes operate in a permissioned network model with specialized roles:

1. **Validator Nodes** - Maintain consensus on the TBchain state
2. **Storage Nodes** - Provide expanded storage capacity for governance data
3. **Bridge Nodes** - Facilitate communication with public blockchains
4. **Access Control Nodes** - Manage and enforce permission systems

The primary advantage of this intermediate layer is its ability to provide privacy-preserving data storage while maintaining verifiable connections to public blockchains. By splitting transactions across layers, TBchain significantly improves scalability while preserving security guarantees[^9][^12].

### Layer Interaction Model

The three layers interact through a defined protocol ensuring consistent state updates and verification paths:

1. **Core-to-TBchain Interactions**:
   - Governance actions on the core layer generate events captured by TBchain
   - TBchain state roots are periodically anchored to the core layer for verification
   - Cross-referencing ensures data consistency between layers
2. **TBchain-to-IPFS Interactions**:
   - Large governance datasets are stored on IPFS with references maintained in TBchain
   - TBchain nodes maintain IPFS pinning services for data availability
   - Content verification ensures IPFS data matches TBchain references

Each layer provides specialized capabilities optimized for different aspects of governance data:

| Layer            | Primary Functions                     | Storage Duration | Privacy Level | Cost Efficiency |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------ | :-------------- |
| Core Layer       | Commitments, nullifiers, verification | Permanent        | Public        | Low             |
| TBchain          | Governance data, access controls      | Long-term        | Configurable  | Medium          |
| Extended Storage | Large datasets, documentation         | Configurable     | High          | High            |

This layered approach provides significant advantages over monolithic storage solutions, enabling zkVote to scale while maintaining robust security guarantees and privacy protections[^9].

## Data Availability Integration

### EigenDA Integration

zkVote integrates with EigenDA to provide a high-security, Ethereum-aligned data availability solution optimized for governance applications requiring robust security guarantees. EigenDA's architecture leverages Ethereum's security model through restaking, making it particularly suitable for high-value governance decisions[^10].

The integration architecture consists of the following components:

1. **EigenDA Dispatcher** - Responsible for encoding governance data and submitting it to EigenDA dispersers
2. **Verification Client** - Validates data availability attestations from EigenDA
3. **Recovery Service** - Enables data retrieval and reconstruction from EigenDA validators

EigenDA's architecture provides several key benefits for governance applications:

- **Information-theoretically minimal data overhead** - Reed-Solomon encoding with KZG polynomial opening proofs
- **Security at scale** - Optimized security properties relative to data storage and transmission costs
- **Scalable unit economics** - Total data transmission volume within 10x of theoretical minimum[^10]

The EigenDA integration leverages specialized configuration optimized for governance data:

```javascript
// EigenDA configuration for zkVote
const eigenDAConfig = {
  // Security parameters
  minQuorum: 0.67, // Minimum validator quorum
  securityLevel: "high", // Security classification

  // Performance optimization
  batchingEnabled: true, // Enable batching of governance operations
  dispersalShards: 128, // Number of data shards

  // Reed-Solomon encoding parameters
  dataShards: 85, // Number of data shards
  parityShards: 43, // Number of parity shards
};
```

EigenDA integration provides the following benefits for zkVote:

1. **Inherited Security** - Leverage Ethereum's security model through the restaking mechanism
2. **Optimized Verification** - Efficient KZG commitments for data verification
3. **Scalable Throughput** - Current throughput of 0.45MB/s with potential for 6-8MB/s
4. **Ethereum Alignment** - Maintains governance legitimacy within the Ethereum ecosystem[^10][^11]

### Celestia Integration

zkVote integrates with Celestia to provide a cost-effective, high-throughput data availability solution optimized for governance applications with higher transaction volumes and cost sensitivity. Celestia's architecture decouples data availability from consensus, providing specialized DA services with lower operating costs[^11].

The integration architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Celestia Connector** - Manages communication with Celestia's DA layer
2. **Namespace Manager** - Organizes governance data into appropriate Celestia namespaces
3. **Light Client** - Facilitates Data Availability Sampling (DAS) for efficient verification
4. **Blob Manager** - Handles data encoding and submission to Celestia

Celestia's architecture provides several key innovations for governance applications:

- **Modular DA Network** - Separates execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability
- **Data Availability Sampling (DAS)** - Allows light nodes to verify data availability efficiently
- **Namespace Merkle Trees (NMTs)** - Enables data partitioning for efficient processing[^11]

The Celestia connector employs specialized configuration settings:

```javascript
// Celestia configuration for zkVote
const celestiaConfig = {
  // Namespace configuration
  baseNamespace: "0x676f7665726e616e6365", // "governance" in hex
  namespaceStrategy: "proposal-specific", // Namespace allocation strategy

  // Performance parameters
  blobSizeTarget: 1024 * 1024, // Target blob size of 1MB
  samplingRatio: 0.15, // DAS sampling ratio
};
```

Celestia integration provides the following benefits for zkVote:

1. **High Throughput** - Supports data throughput of approximately 6.67MB/s
2. **Cost Efficiency** - Significantly lower operating costs (up to 90% savings) compared to alternatives
3. **Namespace Organization** - Logical separation of governance data using namespaces
4. **Light Client Verification** - Efficient data verification through DAS[^11]

### Comparative Analysis and Selection Strategy

zkVote implements a dynamic selection strategy between EigenDA and Celestia based on governance requirements, enabling protocol implementations to optimize for security, cost, throughput, or Ethereum alignment[^11].

The following table summarizes the key differences between EigenDA and Celestia integration options:

| Parameter                 | EigenDA            | Celestia                  | Selection Consideration |
| :------------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| Security Model            | Ethereum restaking | Independent PoS network   | Security requirements   |
| Network Value             | Subset of Ethereum | ~1.2B USD                 | Risk tolerance          |
| Throughput                | 0.45MB/s - 8MB/s   | ~6.67MB/s                 | Transaction volume      |
| Cost Efficiency           | Higher cost        | Lower cost (~90% savings) | Budget constraints      |
| Ethereum Alignment        | Strong alignment   | Independent               | Governance philosophy   |
| Implementation Complexity | Moderate           | Low                       | Development resources   |

The selection strategy determines the optimal DA solution based on governance parameters:

1. **Security-critical governance** - EigenDA preferred for high-value decisions requiring strong security
2. **Cost-sensitive implementations** - Celestia preferred for applications with budget constraints
3. **High-throughput requirements** - Celestia preferred for applications with large transaction volumes
4. **Ethereum ecosystem alignment** - EigenDA preferred for applications requiring Ethereum legitimacy

For many implementations, a hybrid approach leveraging both solutions for different aspects of governance provides the optimal balance of capabilities[^11].

## IPFS Pinning Architecture

### Redundancy Mechanisms

The zkVote protocol implements a sophisticated IPFS pinning architecture to ensure governance data remains available, resilient, and verifiable. This architecture employs multiple redundancy mechanisms to prevent data loss and maintain availability under diverse network conditions.

The core redundancy model includes:

1. **Distributed Pinning Network** - A network of specialized pinning services dedicated to governance data
2. **Stake-weighted Pinning** - Pinning responsibility distributed based on governance stake
3. **Geographic Distribution** - Strategic distribution of pinned content across geographic regions
4. **Replication Policy** - Dynamic replication factor based on data criticality

The implementation leverages the following pinning strategy:

```typescript
// IPFS pinning strategy implementation
interface PinningStrategy {
  minReplicationFactor: number;
  targetReplicationFactor: number;
  maxReplicationFactor: number;
  geographicDistribution: GeographicDistribution;
  pinningServices: PinningService[];
  verificationFrequency: number;
  refreshPolicy: RefreshPolicy;
}
```

For critical governance data, zkVote implements enhanced redundancy with a minimum replication factor of 5, distributed across at least 3 geographic regions. This ensures that even in the event of regional network disruptions or service outages, governance data remains accessible.

The pinning system continuously monitors the availability of stored data and automatically initiates recovery procedures when availability drops below configured thresholds. This proactive approach prevents data loss before it impacts governance operations.

### Content Addressing and Verification

zkVote implements robust content addressing and verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of governance data stored on IPFS. The system leverages cryptographic verification to create a chain of trust from on-chain references to off-chain data[^9].

The content verification system includes:

1. **On-chain Content Roots** - Merkle roots of governance data stored on the core layer
2. **Linked Verification** - Chain of verification from on-chain roots to IPFS content
3. **Metadata Validation** - Verification of governance metadata alongside content
4. **Attestation Framework** - Multi-party attestations to content validity

The verification structure maintains cryptographic links between storage layers:

```typescript
// Content verification structure
interface VerifiableContent {
  cid: string;
  contentType: string;
  size: number;
  merkleRoot: string;
  signature: {
    signer: string;
    signature: string;
    timestamp: number;
  };
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  crossReferences: {
    proposalId?: string;
    tbchainReference?: string;
    onChainRoot?: string;
    relatedCids?: string[];
  };
}
```

The content addressing system implements Content Addressable aRchives (CAR) for efficient governance data management. This approach enables:

1. **Atomic Updates** - Bundled updates to related content
2. **Efficient Transfer** - Optimized data transfer between storage layers
3. **Verification Efficiency** - Streamlined verification of complex governance datasets
4. **Versioning Support** - Implicit versioning through content addressing

This comprehensive verification system ensures that governance data stored on IPFS maintains a verifiable connection to on-chain state, preserving the integrity of the governance record[^9].

## Time-based Access Controls

### Temporal Permission Framework

zkVote implements a sophisticated temporal permission framework to control access to governance data based on time constraints, voting phases, and governance lifecycle events. This framework enables fine-grained control over when different participants can access specific governance information.

The temporal permission system implements the following core concepts:

1. **Time-bound Permissions** - Access rights that activate and expire based on blockchain timestamps
2. **Phase-based Access Control** - Different access rights during proposal, voting, and execution phases
3. **Time-locked Encryption** - Data encrypted until specific blockchain conditions are met
4. **Temporal Roles** - Role-based access control with temporal constraints

The permission model is defined using the following structures:

```typescript
// Temporal permission model
interface TemporalPermission {
  resourceId: string; // Identifier for the protected resource
  granteeIdentifier: string; // Identity receiving the permission
  permissionType: string; // Type of permission (read, write, etc.)
  temporalConstraints: {
    activationTime?: number; // When permission becomes active (timestamp)
    expirationTime?: number; // When permission expires (timestamp)
    blockHeight?: {
      // Block height constraints
      activation?: number; // Block when permission activates
      expiration?: number; // Block when permission expires
    };
    governancePhase?: {
      // Governance phase constraints
      phases: GovPhase[]; // Phases when permission is valid
      proposalId?: string; // Associated proposal if phase-specific
    };
  };
}
```

This framework enables sophisticated governance workflows such as:

- Embargoed vote results that remain encrypted until voting concludes
- Phased disclosure of sensitive governance information
- Time-limited delegate access to voting capabilities
- Automatic permission expiration based on governance events

By integrating temporal constraints with access controls, zkVote ensures that governance data is available to the right participants at the right time, enhancing both security and transparency.

### Implementation Details

The temporal access control system is implemented through a combination of on-chain verification and off-chain enforcement mechanisms:

#### On-chain Time Locks

Smart contracts enforce time-based access through time lock mechanisms:

```solidity
// Time-locked access control contract
contract TemporalAccessControl {
    // Mapping from resource to time-lock parameters
    mapping(bytes32 => TimeLock) public resourceTimeLocks;

    struct TimeLock {
        uint256 releaseTime;
        bytes32 accessCondition;
        address controller;
        bool released;
    }

    // Create a new time lock for a resource
    function createTimeLock(
        bytes32 resourceId,
        uint256 releaseTime,
        bytes32 accessCondition
    ) external {
        require(releaseTime > block.timestamp, "Release time must be in future");

        resourceTimeLocks[resourceId] = TimeLock({
            releaseTime: releaseTime,
            accessCondition: accessCondition,
            controller: msg.sender,
            released: false
        });

        emit TimeLockCreated(resourceId, releaseTime, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

#### Time-bound Encryption

The system implements time-bound encryption for sensitive governance data using a specialized encryption scheme that leverages on-chain conditions for decryption authorization. This approach ensures that even if encrypted data is accessible, it cannot be decrypted until time-based conditions are met.

The time-based disclosure mechanism is particularly valuable for governance results, allowing for:

1. **Phased Disclosure** - Results revealed according to a predetermined schedule
2. **Conditional Revelation** - Disclosure based on governance events rather than absolute time
3. **Partial Disclosure** - Selective revelation of results while maintaining privacy for sensitive aspects
4. **Verifiable Time Constraints** - Cryptographic proof that disclosure rules were followed

This comprehensive time-based access control system ensures that governance data is available to the right participants at the right time, maintaining the integrity of governance processes while enabling appropriate transparency.

## Security Considerations

The zkVote Data Availability \& Storage Architecture includes several security considerations to protect against various threats while maintaining data integrity and availability:

### Data Confidentiality

- **Encryption at Rest** - All sensitive governance data is encrypted while stored
- **Targeted Disclosure** - Information is disclosed only to authorized participants
- **Privacy-Preserving Indexing** - Index structures reveal minimal information about content

The architecture implements privacy-preserving content indexing that maintains confidentiality even in public storage contexts:

```solidity
// Privacy-preserving content indexing
contract SecureContentIndex {
    // Map content identifiers to hashed metadata
    mapping(bytes32 => bytes32) private contentMetadataHashes;

    // Register content in privacy-preserving manner
    function registerContent(bytes32 contentId, bytes calldata encryptedMetadata) external {
        // Store only the hash of the metadata
        contentMetadataHashes[contentId] = keccak256(encryptedMetadata);

        // Emit minimal event information
        emit ContentRegistered(contentId);
    }
}
```

### Data Integrity

- **Immutable Content Addressing** - IPFS content addressing ensures data integrity
- **Cross-Layer Verification** - Multi-layer hash verification between storage layers
- **Cryptographic Attestations** - Multi-party attestations to data validity

The architecture implements cross-layer integrity verification to ensure consistency across all storage tiers. This approach allows the system to detect and remediate inconsistencies before they impact governance operations.

### Data Availability Guarantees

- **Redundant Storage** - Multiple storage layers with different availability characteristics
- **Economic Incentives** - Staking requirements for storage providers
- **Monitoring and Recovery** - Active monitoring with recovery procedures
- **Graceful Degradation** - Layered availability with fallback mechanisms

The system continuously monitors availability across all storage layers and initiates automated recovery procedures when availability metrics fall below configured thresholds. This proactive approach prevents data loss before it becomes critical.

### Cross-Chain Security Risks

- **Chain Reorganization Handling** - Protection against temporary chain reorganizations
- **Finality Guarantees** - Wait for appropriate finality on each chain
- **Chain-specific Adaptations** - Adjustments for security models of different chains
- **Consistency Verification** - Cross-chain state verification

The architecture implements chain-specific security adaptations to account for the different security models and finality characteristics of various blockchain networks. This ensures that cross-chain governance maintains consistent security guarantees across all participating chains.
