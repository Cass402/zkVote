## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides an in-depth technical specification of zkVote's privacy-preserving delegation mechanism. Delegation is a fundamental capability in modern governance systems, allowing participants to transfer their voting authority to trusted representatives. However, traditional delegation systems either compromise privacy by revealing delegation relationships or sacrifice verifiability. This specification details zkVote's novel approach to maintain both privacy and verifiability in delegation operations.

### 1.2 Background

Delegation in voting systems enables governance scaling by allowing passive participants to delegate authority to active representatives. However, public delegation creates several problems:

1. **Relationship Exposure**: Public delegation reveals political alignments and trust relationships
2. **Delegate Targeting**: High-profile delegates become targets for undue influence
3. **Coercion Risk**: Participants may be pressured to delegate to specific entities
4. **Privacy Loss**: Delegation trails reveal governance participation patterns

Existing solutions typically make unacceptable tradeoffs between privacy, verifiability, and usability. zkVote introduces a novel approach using advanced cryptographic techniques to enable fully private yet verifiable delegation.

### 1.3 Scope

This document covers:

- Cryptographic foundations for private delegation
- Delegation protocol architecture and components
- Delegation privacy mechanisms
- Protocol flows for key operations
- Security analysis and threat modeling
- Performance considerations and optimizations

## 2. Private Delegation Design Goals

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

The private delegation mechanism aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Relationship Privacy**: Hide the relationship between delegator and delegate
2. **Voting Power Privacy**: Conceal the amount of voting power delegated
3. **Delegate Anonymity**: Allow delegates to remain anonymous if desired
4. **Delegator Privacy**: Protect the identity of delegators
5. **Verifiable Correctness**: Ensure delegation operations follow protocol rules
6. **Chained Delegation**: Support multi-level delegation without compromising privacy
7. **Conditional Delegation**: Enable topic-specific and time-bounded delegation
8. **Efficient Revocation**: Allow delegators to reclaim voting power privately

### 2.2 Technical Requirements

To achieve these objectives, the delegation system must satisfy the following technical requirements:

1. **Cryptographic Soundness**: Provide mathematical guarantees of privacy properties
2. **Composition Security**: Maintain security under composition with other protocol elements
3. **Front-Running Resistance**: Prevent transaction ordering manipulation
4. **Collusion Resistance**: Maintain privacy guarantees even under partial participant collusion
5. **Scalable Performance**: Support thousands of delegation operations with reasonable computational costs
6. **Cross-Chain Capability**: Enable delegation across multiple blockchain environments
7. **Implementation Feasibility**: Use practical cryptographic primitives with proven implementations

## 3. Cryptographic Foundations

### 3.1 Key Cryptographic Primitives

The delegation privacy mechanism relies on the following cryptographic primitives:

#### 3.1.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs allow proving knowledge of a statement without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For delegation, we employ:

- **zk-SNARKs**: For efficient verification of delegation validity
- **Bulletproofs**: For range proofs of delegation amounts (alternative implementation)

#### 3.1.2 Commitment Schemes

Commitments allow a party to commit to a value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to reveal it later:

- **Pedersen Commitments**: `C(x, r) = g^x · h^r` for committing to delegation values
- **Vector Commitments**: For efficient membership proofs in delegation sets

#### 3.1.3 Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses enable receiving funds without revealing the connection to a public identity:

- **One-time Addresses**: Unique addresses for each delegation to prevent linking
- **Ring Signatures**: For proving delegation authorization among a set of potential delegators

#### 3.1.4 Confidential Transactions

Techniques to hide transaction values while ensuring validity:

- **Confidential Assets**: To obscure delegation weight transfers
- **Blinded Signature Schemes**: For authorized-but-anonymous delegation

### 3.2 Cryptographic Protocols

The delegation mechanism combines these primitives into the following protocols:

#### 3.2.1 Private Delegation Protocol

Allows a delegator to transfer voting power to a delegate without revealing the relationship:

1. **Setup**: Generate delegation parameters
2. **Delegate Address Generation**: Create unlinkable delegation address
3. **Delegation Commitment**: Commit to delegation parameters
4. **Zero-Knowledge Delegation Proof**: Prove valid delegation without revealing details
5. **Nullifier Creation**: Prevent double-delegation attacks

#### 3.2.2 Anonymous Voting with Delegated Power

Enables delegates to vote using delegated power without revealing sources:

1. **Aggregated Credential**: Derive voting credential from delegated authorities
2. **Anonymous Voting**: Cast votes using combined authority
3. **Range Proof**: Prove voting weight is within delegated bounds
4. **Delegation Verification**: Verify delegated authority without revealing delegators

#### 3.2.3 Private Revocation Protocol

Allows delegators to reclaim voting power privately:

1. **Revocation Token**: Generate private revocation capability
2. **Zero-Knowledge Revocation**: Reclaim voting power without revealing delegation details
3. **State Update**: Update system state to reflect revocation

## 4. Delegation Protocol Architecture

### 4.1 Architectural Components

![Delegation Protocol Architecture](https://placeholder.com/delegation-protocol-architecture)

The delegation privacy system consists of the following components:

#### 4.1.1 Delegation Manager

Central component coordinating delegation operations:

- Processes delegation requests
- Validates cryptographic proofs
- Updates delegation state
- Manages delegation registry

#### 4.1.2 Identity Registry

Manages participant identities and eligibility:

## 5. Delegation Privacy Mechanisms

### 5.1 Relationship Privacy

To hide the relationship between delegator and delegate:

#### 5.1.1 Stealth Delegation Addresses

Each delegation uses a one-time stealth address:

```
stealthAddress = H(delegatePublicKey || random) * G + delegatePublicKey
```

Only the delegate can compute the private key:

```
stealthPrivateKey = delegatePrivateKey + H(delegatePrivateKey * H(delegatePublicKey || random))
```

#### 5.1.2 Delegation Commitment Scheme

Commitments to delegation details without revealing them:

```
delegationCommitment = H(delegatorID || delegateStealthAddress || weight || constraints || random)
```

#### 5.1.3 Zero-Knowledge Delegation Membership

Prove delegation existence without revealing participants:

```
π_membership = ZKP{(delegatorID, delegateID, weight, r):
    delegationCommitment = H(delegatorID || delegateStealthAddress || weight || constraints || r) ∧
    MerkleProof(delegationCommitment, delegationRoot)
}
```

### 5.2 Voting Power Privacy

To conceal the amount of delegated voting power:

#### 5.2.1 Confidential Voting Weight

Represent voting weight as Pedersen commitment:

```
weightCommitment = g^weight * h^randomness
```

#### 5.2.2 Zero-Knowledge Weight Transfer

Prove valid transfer of voting power:

```
π_weightTransfer = ZKP{(weightOld, weightNew, delegated, r1, r2, r3):
    weightCommitmentOld = g^weightOld * h^r1 ∧
    weightCommitmentNew = g^(weightOld - delegated) * h^r2 ∧
    delegatedCommitment = g^delegated * h^r3 ∧
    delegated ≥ 0 ∧ weightOld ≥ delegated
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Homomorphic Vote Aggregation

Combine voting weights homomorphically:

```
aggregatedWeight = delegatedWeight1 + delegatedWeight2 + ... + delegatedWeightN
aggregatedCommitment = weightCommitment1 * weightCommitment2 * ... * weightCommitmentN
```

### 5.3 Delegate Anonymity

To protect delegate identity:

#### 5.3.1 Delegate Ring Signatures

Allow delegates to prove authorization among a group:

```
ringSignature = Ring.sign(message, delegatePrivateKey, [publicKey1, publicKey2, ..., publicKeyN])
```

#### 5.3.2 Anonymous Credential Issuance

Issue voting credentials without revealing delegate identity:

```
π_credential = ZKP{(delegateID, attributes):
    credential = IssueCredential(delegateID, attributes) ∧
    MerkleProof(H(delegateID), eligibilityRoot)
}
```

#### 5.3.3 Blind Voting Capability

Enable delegates to obtain voting capabilities without revealing identity:

```
blindedRequest = Blind(delegateID || votingParameters)
signedBlindedRequest = Sign(blindedRequest, authorityKey)
votingCapability = Unblind(signedBlindedRequest)
```

### 5.4 Multi-Level Delegation Privacy

To support private chained delegation:

#### 5.4.1 Delegation Chain Commitment

Represent delegation chains without revealing individual relationships:

```
chainCommitment = H(delegation1Commitment || delegation2Commitment || ... || delegationNCommitment)
```

#### 5.4.2 Zero-Knowledge Chain Verification

Verify valid delegation chains without revealing chain contents:

```
π_chain = ZKP{(delegations, weights, path):
    chainCommitment = H(delegations) ∧
    ∀i: delegations[i+1].delegator = delegations[i].delegate ∧
    ∀i: delegations[i].weight ≥ delegations[i+1].weight ∧
    MerkleProof(chainCommitment, delegationChainRoot)
}
```

#### 5.4.3 Path-Preserving Privacy

Maintain privacy of the entire delegation path:

```
pathCommitment = H(encrypt(path, symmetricKey))
pathProof = ZKP{(path, key):
    pathCommitment = H(encrypt(path, key)) ∧
    pathIsValid(path)
}
```

   }
   updateVotingPowerRegistry(reclaimedPowerCommitment)
   ```

## 7. Revocation and Time-Bounded Delegation

### 7.1 Time-Bounded Delegation

#### 7.1.1 Temporal Constraints

Delegations can include temporal constraints:

```
constraints = {
    startTime: timestamp,
    endTime: timestamp,
    absoluteExpiration: timestamp
}
```

Encoded in the delegation commitment:

```
delegationCommitment = H(delegatorIdentity || stealthAddress || delegationAmount || constraints || randomness)
```

#### 7.1.2 Time Verification in ZK

Validate time constraints in zero-knowledge:

```
π_timeValid = ZKP{(currentTime, constraints):
    currentTime ≥ constraints.startTime ∧
    (constraints.endTime == 0 ∨ currentTime ≤ constraints.endTime) ∧
    (constraints.absoluteExpiration == 0 ∨ currentTime ≤ constraints.absoluteExpiration)
}
```

#### 7.1.3 Automatic Expiration

Support for automatic expiration:

1. **Expiration Oracle**: Trusted timestamp provider
2. **Expiration Proof**: Cryptographic proof of time passing
3. **Expiration Record**: On-chain record of expired delegations

```
expirationRecord = {
    delegationPointer: H(delegationCommitment),
    expirationProof: Sign(H("expired" || delegationPointer || timestamp), oracleKey),
    timestamp: currentTimestamp()
}
```

### 7.2 Delegation Revocation Mechanisms

#### 7.2.1 Unilateral Revocation

Delegator can revoke without delegate cooperation:

```
π_unilateralRevoke = ZKP{(delegatorPrivateKey, delegationParams):
    delegatorIdentity = generateIdentityCommitment(delegatorPrivateKey) ∧
    isDelegationCreator(delegatorIdentity, delegationParams)
}
```

#### 7.2.2 Conditional Revocation

Revocation based on predefined conditions:

```
revocationCondition = {
    conditionType: "inactivity" | "vote-against" | "custom",
    conditionParameters: {...},
    conditionEvaluator: contractAddress
}

π_conditionalRevoke = ZKP{(condition, proof):
    revocationCondition.conditionType == delegationParams.revocationConditions.conditionType ∧
    isConditionMet(condition, proof)
}
```

#### 7.2.3 Emergency Revocation

Special revocation mechanism for urgent situations:

```
π_emergencyRevoke = ZKP{(delegatorPrivateKey, emergencyCode):
    delegatorIdentity = generateIdentityCommitment(delegatorPrivateKey) ∧
    emergencyCode == delegationParams.emergencyRevocationCode
}
```

### 7.3 Delegation Transfer Privacy

#### 7.3.1 Re-delegation Privacy

When a delegate further delegates to another delegate:

```
π_redelegation = ZKP{(stealthPrivKey, delegationParams, newDelegationParams):
    canClaimDelegation(stealthPrivKey, delegationParams) ∧
    newDelegationParams.amount ≤ delegationParams.amount ∧
    isRedelegationPermitted(delegationParams)
}
```

#### 7.3.2 Transfer Limitations

Enforce delegation transfer constraints:

```
transferConstraints = {
    maxTransferDepth: uint,
    allowedTransferDomains: [domain1, domain2, ...],
    transferTimeLimit: timestamp
}
```

## 8. Security Analysis

### 8.1 Threat Model

The delegation privacy system is designed to be secure against the following adversaries:

1. **Network Observer**: Passive entity monitoring all blockchain transactions

   - Can see all on-chain data but cannot break cryptographic primitives
   - Cannot observe off-chain communication channels

2. **Malicious Delegator**: Entity attempting to violate protocol rules

   - Controls their own private keys
   - May attempt to delegate more voting power than owned
   - May attempt to double-delegate

3. **Malicious Delegate**: Entity attempting to abuse delegated authority

   - Controls their own private keys
   - May attempt to vote with more authority than delegated
   - May attempt to transfer delegation improperly

4. **Coercive Attacker**: Entity attempting to force specific delegation behavior

   - May apply external pressure on participants
   - Cannot directly compromise cryptographic keys

5. **Collusion Attack**: Multiple entities working together
   - May control multiple participant roles
   - Cannot represent more than threshold percentage of system

### 8.2 Privacy Guarantees

Under the threat model, the system provides the following privacy guarantees:

#### 8.2.1 Relationship Privacy

**Guarantee**: An external observer cannot determine which delegator delegated to which delegate.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[A.identify(delegator, delegate) | view(blockchain)] ≤ 1/n + negl(λ)
```

where:

- A is any polynomial-time adversary
- n is the number of potential delegators/delegates
- λ is the security parameter
- view(blockchain) is the observable blockchain state

#### 8.2.2 Amount Privacy

**Guarantee**: An external observer cannot determine the amount of voting power delegated between any pair of participants.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[|A.estimateAmount(delegation) - actualAmount| < ε | view(blockchain)] ≤ negl(λ)
```

#### 8.2.3 Voting Privacy with Delegation

**Guarantee**: An observer cannot link a vote to the original delegators.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[A.linkVote(vote, delegator) | view(blockchain)] ≤ 1/n + negl(λ)
```

### 8.3 Potential Attacks and Mitigations

| Attack                                 | Description                                                 | Mitigation                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Delegation Graph Analysis**          | Analyzing timing and pattern of delegations                 | Randomized timing, dummy delegations             |
| **Sybil Delegation Attack**            | Creating multiple identities to obscure delegation patterns | Identity verification, delegation limits         |
| **Forced Delegation Disclosure**       | Coercing delegates to reveal delegators                     | Deniable delegation with ring signatures         |
| **Double-Delegation Attack**           | Delegating the same voting power multiple times             | Nullifier enforcement, commitment reconciliation |
| **Selective Delegation Timing Attack** | Timing delegations to reveal preferences                    | Timelock delegation, batched processing          |
| **Side-Channel Leakage**               | Inferring delegation relationships through side channels    | Constant-time operations, noise addition         |

### 8.4 Formal Security Analysis

The security of the delegation privacy mechanism has been analyzed using:

1. **Universal Composability Framework**: Proving security under composition
2. **Simulation-Based Proofs**: Demonstrating indistinguishability from ideal functionality
3. **Game-Based Security Models**: Quantifying advantage against specific attacks

Key security theorems:

**Theorem 1 (Delegation Privacy)**: Under the DDH assumption, no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish between delegations from delegator A to delegate B vs. delegator A to delegate C with advantage better than negligible.

**Theorem 2 (Delegation Integrity)**: Under the discrete logarithm assumption, no polynomial-time adversary can produce a valid delegation with more voting power than they control, except with negligible probability.

**Theorem 3 (Revocation Privacy)**: Under the same assumptions, a revocation cannot be linked to a specific delegation from an external observer's view, except with negligible probability.

| Delegation Revocation  | O(log n)           | O(1)                 | O(1)                     |

where:

- n is the total number of delegations in the system
- m is the number of potential delegators
- d is the number of delegations held by a delegate

### 9.3 Optimization Techniques

#### 9.3.1 Batch Processing

Group multiple delegation operations:

```
batchProof = aggregateProofs([proof_1, proof_2, ..., proof_n])
```

Reduces verification cost from O(n) to O(log n)

#### 9.3.2 Recursive Proof Composition

Use recursive SNARKs to verify delegation chains:

```
chainProof = recursiveProve(previousChainProof, newDelegationProof)
```

Enables O(1) verification regardless of delegation chain length

#### 9.3.3 Caching and Indexing

Efficient structures for delegation discovery:

1. **Bloom filters**: Fast negative responses for delegation checking
2. **Indexed view tags**: Quick filtering of potential delegations
3. **Cached credentials**: Reduce re-computation of frequently used proofs

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### 10.1 Circuit Implementation

The delegation privacy mechanism requires the following circuits:

template DelegationAuthorization() {
    // Input signals
    signal input delegatorPrivateKey;
    signal input delegatorBalance;
    signal input delegationAmount;
    signal input delegatePublicKey;
    signal input randomness;

    // Public inputs
    signal input balanceMerkleRoot;
    signal input delegationCommitment;

    // Output signals
    signal output nullifier;
    signal output valid;

    // Circuit logic
    component hasher = Poseidon(5);
    hasher.inputs[0] <== delegatorPrivateKey;
    hasher.inputs[1] <== delegatePublicKey;
    hasher.inputs[2] <== delegationAmount;
    hasher.inputs[3] <== constraints;
    hasher.inputs[4] <== randomness;

    // Check commitment matches
    delegationCommitment === hasher.out;

    // Check balance sufficient
    delegatorBalance >= delegationAmount;

    // Compute nullifier
    component nullifierHasher = Poseidon(2);
    nullifierHasher.inputs[0] <== delegatorPrivateKey;
    nullifierHasher.inputs[1] <== "delegation";

    nullifier <== nullifierHasher.out;
    valid <== 1;
}
```

#### 10.1.2 Delegation Claim Circuit

```circom
template DelegationClaim() {
    // Input signals
    signal input stealthPrivateKey;
    signal input delegationCommitment;
    signal input delegationParams;

    // Public inputs
    signal input delegationMerkleRoot;

    // Output signals
    signal output claimProof;

    // Circuit logic
    component stealthDeriver = StealthAddressDeriver();
    stealthDeriver.privateKey <== stealthPrivateKey;

    // Verify stealth address matches delegation
    stealthDeriver.stealthAddress === delegationParams.stealthAddress;

    // Verify delegation in Merkle tree
    component merkleVerifier = MerkleProofVerifier(MERKLE_TREE_DEPTH);
    merkleVerifier.leaf <== delegationCommitment;
    merkleVerifier.root <== delegationMerkleRoot;

        bytes32 stealthAddressHint,
        bytes calldata constraints,
        bytes calldata encryptedMetadata,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (bool);

    // Revoke an existing delegation
    function revokeDelegation(
        bytes32 delegationPointer,
        bytes32 revocationNullifier,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (bool);

    // Vote using delegated power
    function voteWithDelegatedPower(
        bytes32[] calldata nullifiers,
        bytes32 voteCommitment,
        bytes32 weightCommitment,
