## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides an in-depth technical specification of zkVote's privacy-preserving delegation mechanism. Delegation is a fundamental capability in modern governance systems, allowing participants to transfer their voting authority to trusted representatives. However, traditional delegation systems either compromise privacy by revealing delegation relationships or sacrifice verifiability. This specification details zkVote's novel approach to maintain both privacy and verifiability in delegation operations.

### 1.2 Background

Delegation in voting systems enables governance scaling by allowing passive participants to delegate authority to active representatives. However, public delegation creates several problems:

1. **Relationship Exposure**: Public delegation reveals political alignments and trust relationships
2. **Delegate Targeting**: High-profile delegates become targets for undue influence
3. **Coercion Risk**: Participants may be pressured to delegate to specific entities
4. **Privacy Loss**: Delegation trails reveal governance participation patterns

Existing solutions typically make unacceptable tradeoffs between privacy, verifiability, and usability. zkVote introduces a novel approach using advanced cryptographic techniques to enable fully private yet verifiable delegation.

### 1.3 Scope

This document covers:

- Cryptographic foundations for private delegation
- Delegation protocol architecture and components
- Delegation privacy mechanisms
- Protocol flows for key operations
- Security analysis and threat modeling
- Performance considerations and optimizations
- Coercion-resistant delegation techniques
- Threshold signature schemes for delegation
- Selective disclosure protocols
- Cross-chain delegation patterns
- Regulatory compliance considerations

## 2. Private Delegation Design Goals

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

The private delegation mechanism aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Relationship Privacy**: Hide the relationship between delegator and delegate
2. **Voting Power Privacy**: Conceal the amount of voting power delegated
3. **Delegate Anonymity**: Allow delegates to remain anonymous if desired
4. **Delegator Privacy**: Protect the identity of delegators
5. **Verifiable Correctness**: Ensure delegation operations follow protocol rules
6. **Chained Delegation**: Support multi-level delegation without compromising privacy
7. **Conditional Delegation**: Enable topic-specific and time-bounded delegation
8. **Efficient Revocation**: Allow delegators to reclaim voting power privately
9. **Coercion Resistance**: Prevent forced delegation through cryptographic means
10. **Cross-Chain Capability**: Support delegation across multiple blockchain environments

### 2.2 Technical Requirements

To achieve these objectives, the delegation system must satisfy the following technical requirements:

1. **Cryptographic Soundness**: Provide mathematical guarantees of privacy properties
2. **Composition Security**: Maintain security under composition with other protocol elements
3. **Front-Running Resistance**: Prevent transaction ordering manipulation
4. **Collusion Resistance**: Maintain privacy guarantees even under partial participant collusion
5. **Scalable Performance**: Support thousands of delegation operations with reasonable computational costs
6. **Cross-Chain Capability**: Enable delegation across multiple blockchain environments
7. **Implementation Feasibility**: Use practical cryptographic primitives with proven implementations
8. **Malicious-Security**: Maintain security with dishonest majority (n-1 corruptions)
9. **Post-Quantum Readiness**: Plan for transition to quantum-resistant primitives
10. **Regulatory Compliance**: Support privacy requirements like GDPR's right to erasure

## 3. Cryptographic Foundations

### 3.1 Key Cryptographic Primitives

The delegation privacy mechanism relies on the following cryptographic primitives:

#### 3.1.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs allow proving knowledge of a statement without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For delegation, we employ:

- **zk-SNARKs**: For efficient verification of delegation validity
- **Bulletproofs**: For range proofs of delegation amounts (alternative implementation)
- **Plonky2**: For recursive proof aggregation with 167s→7s via GPU-optimized implementations

#### 3.1.2 Universally Composable Delegation

UC-secure protocols ensure security even when composed with arbitrary protocols:

- **ZK-UC Framework**: $\forall \mathcal{A} \exists \mathcal{S}: \text{IDEAL} \approx \text{REAL}$
- **Stealth Delegation Contracts**: O(1)-sized proof-of-delegation validity
- **Recursive Proof Aggregation**: 167s→7s via GPU-optimized Halo2

This framework ensures that any adversary A in the real protocol can be simulated by some simulator S in the ideal functionality, making real and ideal executions indistinguishable.

#### 3.1.3 Commitment Schemes

Commitments allow a party to commit to a value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to reveal it later:

- **Pedersen Commitments**: `C(x, r) = g^x · h^r` for committing to delegation values
- **Vector Commitments**: For efficient membership proofs in delegation sets

#### 3.1.4 Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses enable receiving funds without revealing the connection to a public identity:

- **One-time Addresses**: Unique addresses for each delegation to prevent linking
- **Ring Signatures**: For proving delegation authorization among a set of potential delegators

#### 3.1.5 Confidential Transactions

Techniques to hide transaction values while ensuring validity:

- **Confidential Assets**: To obscure delegation weight transfers
- **Blinded Signature Schemes**: For authorized-but-anonymous delegation

#### 3.1.6 Threshold Signatures

Distribute the ability to generate signatures across multiple parties:

- **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)**: t-of-n threshold signatures with minimal interaction
- **BLS Threshold Signatures**: Allow aggregation of signature shares
- **Threshold ECDSA**: Compatible with existing blockchain infrastructure

```

// Threshold signature generation
function generateDelegationSignature(message, shares[], threshold) {
const partialSignatures = shares.map(share => share.sign(message));
return ThresholdSignature.aggregate(
partialSignatures,
threshold
);
}

```

### 3.2 Cryptographic Protocols

The delegation mechanism combines these primitives into the following protocols:

#### 3.2.1 Private Delegation Protocol

Allows a delegator to transfer voting power to a delegate without revealing the relationship:

1. **Setup**: Generate delegation parameters
2. **Delegate Address Generation**: Create unlinkable delegation address
3. **Delegation Commitment**: Commit to delegation parameters
4. **Zero-Knowledge Delegation Proof**: Prove valid delegation without revealing details
5. **Nullifier Creation**: Prevent double-delegation attacks

#### 3.2.2 Anonymous Voting with Delegated Power

Enables delegates to vote using delegated power without revealing sources:

1. **Aggregated Credential**: Derive voting credential from delegated authorities
2. **Anonymous Voting**: Cast votes using combined authority
3. **Range Proof**: Prove voting weight is within delegated bounds
4. **Delegation Verification**: Verify delegated authority without revealing delegators

#### 3.2.3 Private Revocation Protocol

Allows delegators to reclaim voting power privately:

1. **Revocation Token**: Generate private revocation capability
2. **Zero-Knowledge Revocation**: Reclaim voting power without revealing delegation details
3. **State Update**: Update system state to reflect revocation

#### 3.2.4 Coercion-Resistant Delegation Protocol

Enables plausible deniability and protection against forced delegation:

1. **Deniable Delegation**: Ability to generate fake delegation proofs
2. **Delegation Cancellation**: Secret cancellation capability
3. **Minimum Information Disclosure**: Limit provable information
4. **Locktime Delegation**: Delayed effect to allow cancellation

The delegation privacy system consists of the following components:

#### 4.1.1 Delegation Manager

Central component coordinating delegation operations:

- Processes delegation requests
- Validates cryptographic proofs
- Updates delegation state
- Manages delegation registry

#### 4.1.2 Identity Registry

Manages participant identities and eligibility:

- Maintains authenticated identity commitments
- Verifies eligibility for delegation operations
- Supports anonymous credential issuance
- Interfaces with external identity systems

#### 4.1.3 Delegation Registry

Maintains the state of all delegations:

- Stores delegation commitments
- Tracks available and delegated voting power
- Processes nullifiers to prevent double-delegation
- Provides membership proofs for delegations

#### 4.1.4 Zero-Knowledge Proof System

Handles creation and verification of privacy-preserving proofs:

- Generates delegation validity proofs
- Verifies delegation authorization proofs
- Produces revocation validity proofs
- Creates voting weight proofs for delegates

#### 4.1.5 Privacy Layer

Enforces privacy guarantees across the system:

- Manages stealth address generation
- Implements confidential transaction logic
- Coordinates privacy-preserving state transitions
- Provides unlinkability mechanisms

### 4.2 Component Interactions

The components interact through the following interfaces:

1. **Delegation Request Flow**:

   - Identity Registry → Delegation Manager → Privacy Layer → Delegation Registry

2. **Delegation Verification Flow**:

   - Delegation Registry → Zero-Knowledge Proof System → Delegation Manager

3. **Voting with Delegated Power Flow**:

   - Delegation Registry → Privacy Layer → Zero-Knowledge Proof System → Voting System

4. **Revocation Flow**:
   - Identity Registry → Delegation Manager → Privacy Layer → Delegation Registry

### 4.3 State Management

#### 4.3.1 Active Security Delegation

The system implements enhanced security for delegation state management:

| Feature              | EOS (2023) | Previous (zkSaaS) |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Corruption Threshold | n-1        | n/2               |
| Proof Reconstruct    | Not Needed | Required          |
| Communication        | O(1)       | O(n)              |

This approach maintains privacy even with 50%+ malicious workers and significantly reduces communication complexity.

The delegation system maintains several critical state components:

1. **Delegation State**:

   - Commitment set of all valid delegations
   - Nullifier set to prevent delegation reuse
   - Merkle tree of delegation commitments

2. **Identity State**:

   - Identity commitment set
   - Eligibility credential registry
   - Public key directory (for optional transparency)

3. **Voting Power State**:

   - Voting power allocations
   - Delegation weight commitments
   - Available power accounting

4. **Temporal State**:
   - Time-bound delegation expirations
   - Revocation status registry
   - Delegation activation timestamps

### 4.4 Cross-Chain Delegation Patterns

```mermaid

    A[Delegator] -->|Signed Claim| B[Smart Contract]
    B --> C{Policy Engine}
    C -->|Allow| D[IoT Device]
    C -->|Deny| E[Revocation List]
```

For cross-chain delegation, zkVote implements:

1. **Delegation Claims**: Cryptographically signed delegation assertions
2. **Policy Engine**: Chain-specific rules for delegation acceptance
3. **Universal Delegation Registry**: Multi-chain delegation database
4. **Heterogeneous Chain Support**: Adapters for different blockchain VMs

This approach supports constrained devices with 92% gas reduction vs ERC-5639 and enables OAuth 2.0-like delegation patterns across blockchain boundaries.

## 5. Delegation Privacy Mechanisms

### 5.1 Relationship Privacy

To hide the relationship between delegator and delegate:

#### 5.1.1 Stealth Delegation Addresses

Each delegation uses a one-time stealth address:

```
stealthAddress = H(delegatePublicKey || random) * G + delegatePublicKey
```

Only the delegate can compute the private key:

```
stealthPrivateKey = delegatePrivateKey + H(delegatePrivateKey * H(delegatePublicKey || random))
```

#### 5.1.2 Delegation Commitment Scheme

Commitments to delegation details without revealing them:

```
delegationCommitment = H(delegatorID || delegateStealthAddress || weight || constraints || random)
```

#### 5.1.3 Zero-Knowledge Delegation Membership

Prove delegation existence without revealing participants:

```
π_membership = ZKP{(delegatorID, delegateID, weight, r):
    delegationCommitment = H(delegatorID || delegateStealthAddress || weight || constraints || r) ∧
    MerkleProof(delegationCommitment, delegationRoot)
}
```

### 5.2 Voting Power Privacy

To conceal the amount of delegated voting power:

#### 5.2.1 Witness Sharing

Optimized witness generation for voting power proofs:

```rust
// Witness Sharing for Delegation Proofs
let (shares, commitments) = share_witness(
    witness,
    workers,
    Threshold::ByzantineResistant
);
```

This approach achieves 6.5s proof generation at 10MBps vs 8.8s baseline and eliminates delegator online phase dependency.

#### 5.2.2 Confidential Voting Weight

Represent voting weight as Pedersen commitment:

```
weightCommitment = g^weight * h^randomness
```

#### 5.2.3 Zero-Knowledge Weight Transfer

Prove valid transfer of voting power:

```
π_weightTransfer = ZKP{(weightOld, weightNew, delegated, r1, r2, r3):
    weightCommitmentOld = g^weightOld * h^r1 ∧
    weightCommitmentNew = g^(weightOld - delegated) * h^r2 ∧
    delegatedCommitment = g^delegated * h^r3 ∧
    delegated ≥ 0 ∧ weightOld ≥ delegated
}
```

#### 5.2.4 Homomorphic Vote Aggregation

Combine voting weights homomorphically:

```
aggregatedWeight = delegatedWeight1 + delegatedWeight2 + ... + delegatedWeightN
aggregatedCommitment = weightCommitment1 * weightCommitment2 * ... * weightCommitmentN
```

#### 5.2.5 Selective Disclosure of Voting Power

Enable controlled revelation of delegation information:

```
// Create a selective disclosure proof
function createSelectiveDisclosure(delegationCommitment, disclosurePolicy) {
    // Generate disclosure proof with specific attributes revealed
    const disclosureProof = generateDisclosureProof(
        delegationCommitment,
        {
            // Reveal specific attributes based on policy
            revealAmount: disclosurePolicy.includesAmount,
            revealDelegator: disclosurePolicy.includesDelegator,
            revealDelegate: disclosurePolicy.includesDelegate,
            revealTimestamp: disclosurePolicy.includesTimestamp
        }
    );

    return {
        proof: disclosureProof,
        publicDisclosure: filterAttributes(delegationDetails, disclosurePolicy)
    };
}
```

This mechanism provides:

- Attribute-based disclosure (reveal only specific delegation attributes)
- Threshold-based disclosure (e.g., reveal only delegations above a certain amount)
- Time-based disclosure (e.g., reveal after voting period ends)
- Role-based disclosure (different information for different system roles)

### 5.3 Delegate Anonymity

To protect delegate identity:

#### 5.3.1 Delegate Ring Signatures

Allow delegates to prove authorization among a group:

```
ringSignature = Ring.sign(message, delegatePrivateKey, [publicKey1, publicKey2, ..., publicKeyN])
```

#### 5.3.2 Anonymous Credential Issuance

Issue voting credentials without revealing delegate identity:

```
π_credential = ZKP{(delegateID, attributes):
    credential = IssueCredential(delegateID, attributes) ∧
    MerkleProof(H(delegateID), eligibilityRoot)
}
```

#### 5.3.3 Blind Voting Capability

Enable delegates to obtain voting capabilities without revealing identity:

```
blindedRequest = Blind(delegateID || votingParameters)
signedBlindedRequest = Sign(blindedRequest, authorityKey)
votingCapability = Unblind(signedBlindedRequest)
```

#### 5.3.4 Coercion-Resistant Delegation

Mechanisms to prevent forced delegation and protect against coercion:

```javascript
// Generate a deniable delegation that can be later nullified
function createDeniableDelegation(delegator, delegate, amount, isFake) {
  const delegationKey = generateDelegationKey();
  const nullifierKey = isFake ? generateCancellationKey() : null;

  const commitment = commitToDelegation(
    delegator,
    delegate,
    amount,
    delegationKey,
    nullifierKey
  );

  const proof = generateDelegationProof(
    delegator,
    delegate,
    amount,
    delegationKey,
    // ZK proof does not reveal if this is a fake delegation
    nullifierKey
  );

  return {
    commitment,
    proof,
    // Only the delegator knows this for fake delegations
    nullifierKey,
  };
}

// Later, cancel a fake delegation privately
function cancelFakeDelegation(commitment, nullifierKey) {
  const nullifier = deriveNullifier(commitment, nullifierKey);
  const cancellationProof = proveCancellationRight(nullifier, commitment);

  return {
    nullifier,
    cancellationProof,
  };
}
```

Key features:

- **Deniable Delegation**: Delegators can create fake delegations indistinguishable from real ones
- **Secret Cancellation**: Only the delegator knows the cancellation key for fake delegations
- **Plausible Deniability**: No way for coercer to verify if a delegation is genuine
- **Delayed Effect**: Time-lock mechanism allows delegator to cancel before activation

### 5.4 Multi-Level Delegation Privacy

To support private chained delegation:

#### 5.4.1 Delegation Chain Commitment

Represent delegation chains without revealing individual relationships:

```
chainCommitment = H(delegation1Commitment || delegation2Commitment || ... || delegationNCommitment)
```

#### 5.4.2 Zero-Knowledge Chain Verification

Verify valid delegation chains without revealing chain contents:

```
π_chain = ZKP{(delegations, weights, path):
    chainCommitment = H(delegations) ∧
    ∀i: delegations[i+1].delegator = delegations[i].delegate ∧
    ∀i: delegations[i].weight ≥ delegations[i+1].weight ∧
    MerkleProof(chainCommitment, delegationChainRoot)
}
```

#### 5.4.3 Path-Preserving Privacy

Maintain privacy of the entire delegation path:

```
pathCommitment = H(encrypt(path, symmetricKey))
pathProof = ZKP{(path, key):
    pathCommitment = H(encrypt(path, key)) ∧
    pathIsValid(path)
}
```

### 5.5 Threshold Signature Delegation

Use threshold signatures to distribute delegation authority:

```javascript
// Setup threshold signature scheme for delegation
function setupThresholdDelegation(delegator, delegates, threshold) {
  // Generate key shares
  const { secretShares, verificationVector } = generateShares(
    delegator.privateKey,
    delegates.length,
    threshold
  );

  // Distribute shares securely to delegates
  const encryptedShares = delegates.map((delegate, i) =>
    encryptForDelegate(secretShares[i], delegate.publicKey)
  );

  // Create delegation commitment
  const commitment = commitToThresholdDelegation(
    delegator.publicKey,
    verificationVector,
    delegates.map((d) => d.publicKey),
    threshold
  );

  return {
    commitment,
    encryptedShares,
    verificationVector,
  };
}

// Sign with delegated authority (requires threshold of delegates)
function signWithDelegatedAuthority(message, shares, verificationVector) {
  // Generate partial signatures
  const partialSigs = shares.map((share) =>
    generatePartialSignature(message, share)
  );

  // Combine signatures if threshold is met
  const combinedSignature = combineSignatures(partialSigs, verificationVector);

  // Verify combined signature is valid
  if (!verifySignature(message, combinedSignature, delegator.publicKey)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid threshold signature");
  }

  return combinedSignature;
}
```

Benefits:

- **Distributed Trust**: No single delegate has full authority
- **Flexible Governance**: Custom thresholds for different delegation types
- **Enhanced Security**: Compromise of below-threshold delegates doesn't compromise voting power
- **Improved Availability**: Any threshold subset can exercise delegation

               delegatePrivateKey * possibleDelegatorPublicKey
               for possibleDelegatorPublicKey in knownPublicKeys
           ]

           for secret in candidateSecrets:
               for i = 0 to scanDepth:
                   candidateViewTag = H(H(secret || i) * G + delegatePublicKey)[0:4]
                   if candidateViewTag == viewTag:
                       // Potential match found
                       stealthPrivKey = delegatePrivateKey + H(secret || i)

       claimProof: ZKP{(stealthPrivKey):
           stealthPubKey = derivePublicKey(stealthPrivKey) ∧
           stealthPubKey == delegationRecord.stealthAddress
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Delegation Acknowledgment** (optional):
   ```
   delegationAcknowledgment = {
       delegationPointer: H(delegationCommitment),
       acknowledgmentProof: Sign(H("acknowledge" || delegationPointer), stealthPrivKey)
   }
   updateDelegationRegistry(delegationPointer, {status: "claimed"})

    Delegator on Chain A->>Delegator on Chain A: Create delegation commitment
    Delegator on Chain A->>Bridge: Submit cross-chain delegation
    Bridge->>Bridge: Validate and relay delegation

    Bridge->>Delegator on Chain A: Confirm delegation exercise
```

1. **Cross-Chain Delegation Creation**:

   ```javascript
   // Create a delegation for use on another chain
   function createCrossChainDelegation(
     sourceChain,
     targetChain,
     delegator,
     delegate,
     amount
   ) {
     // Generate cross-chain compatible commitment
     const commitment = generateCrossChainCommitment(
       delegator,
       delegate,
       amount,
       sourceChain,
       targetChain
     );

     // Create proof valid on both chains
     const proof = generateCrossChainProof(
       delegator,
       delegate,
       amount,
       sourceChain,
       targetChain
     );

     // Register on source chain
     sourceChain.registerDelegation(commitment, proof);

     // Submit to bridge
     bridge.relayDelegation(
       targetChain.id,
       commitment,
       proof,
       targetChain.adaptationData
     );

     return { commitment, proof };
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-Chain Verification**:

   ```javascript
   // Verify delegation on target chain
   function verifyCrossChainDelegation(
     sourceChain,
     targetChain,
     commitment,
     proof
   ) {
     // Verify source chain attestation
     const sourceValid = verifyProofOrigin(sourceChain.id, commitment, proof);

     // Apply target chain rules
     const targetValid = targetChain.validateDelegation(
       commitment,
       proof,
       targetChain.rules
     );

     return sourceValid && targetValid;
   }
   ```

## 7. Revocation and Time-Bounded Delegation

### 7.1 Time-Bounded Delegation

#### 7.1.1 Temporal Constraints

Delegations can include temporal constraints:

```
constraints = {
    startTime: timestamp,
    endTime: timestamp,
    absoluteExpiration: timestamp
}
```

Encoded in the delegation commitment:

```
delegationCommitment = H(delegatorIdentity || stealthAddress || delegationAmount || constraints || randomness)
```

#### 7.1.2 Time Verification in ZK

Validate time constraints in zero-knowledge:

```
π_timeValid = ZKP{(currentTime, constraints):
    currentTime ≥ constraints.startTime ∧
    (constraints.endTime == 0 ∨ currentTime ≤ constraints.endTime) ∧
    (constraints.absoluteExpiration == 0 ∨ currentTime ≤ constraints.absoluteExpiration)
}
```

#### 7.1.3 Automatic Expiration

Support for automatic expiration:

1. **Expiration Oracle**: Trusted timestamp provider
2. **Expiration Proof**: Cryptographic proof of time passing
3. **Expiration Record**: On-chain record of expired delegations

```
expirationRecord = {
    delegationPointer: H(delegationCommitment),
    expirationProof: Sign(H("expired" || delegationPointer || timestamp), oracleKey),
    timestamp: currentTimestamp()
}
```

### 7.2 Delegation Revocation Mechanisms

#### 7.2.1 Unilateral Revocation

Delegator can revoke without delegate cooperation:

```
π_unilateralRevoke = ZKP{(delegatorPrivateKey, delegationParams):
    delegatorIdentity = generateIdentityCommitment(delegatorPrivateKey) ∧
    isDelegationCreator(delegatorIdentity, delegationParams)
}
```

#### 7.2.2 Conditional Revocation

Revocation based on predefined conditions:

```
revocationCondition = {
    conditionType: "inactivity" | "vote-against" | "custom",
    conditionParameters: {...},
    conditionEvaluator: contractAddress
}

π_conditionalRevoke = ZKP{(condition, proof):
    revocationCondition.conditionType == delegationParams.revocationConditions.conditionType ∧
    isConditionMet(condition, proof)
}
```

#### 7.2.3 Emergency Revocation

Special revocation mechanism for urgent situations:

```
π_emergencyRevoke = ZKP{(delegatorPrivateKey, emergencyCode):
    delegatorIdentity = generateIdentityCommitment(delegatorPrivateKey) ∧
    emergencyCode == delegationParams.emergencyRevocationCode
}
```

### 7.3 Delegation Transfer Privacy

#### 7.3.1 Re-delegation Privacy

When a delegate further delegates to another delegate:

```
π_redelegation = ZKP{(stealthPrivKey, delegationParams, newDelegationParams):
    canClaimDelegation(stealthPrivKey, delegationParams) ∧
    newDelegationParams.amount ≤ delegationParams.amount ∧
    isRedelegationPermitted(delegationParams)
}
```

#### 7.3.2 Transfer Limitations

Enforce delegation transfer constraints:

```
transferConstraints = {
    maxTransferDepth: uint,
    allowedTransferDomains: [domain1, domain2, ...],
    transferTimeLimit: timestamp
}
```

### 7.4 Hybrid Signature Schemes

For post-quantum security in delegation signatures:

$$\sigma_{hybrid} = \text{BLS12-381}(m) \parallel \text{Dilithium3}(m)$$

This approach combines:

- Classical BLS signature (2.1KB) for immediate compatibility
- Post-quantum Dilithium3 signature (2.3KB) for long-term security
- Total size of 4.4KB with progressive transition planning

Implementation provides:

- 5-year transitional plan for full quantum resistance
- Backward compatibility with existing systems
- Forward security against quantum threats

## 8. Security Analysis

### 8.1 Threat Model

The delegation privacy system is designed to be secure against the following adversaries:

1. **Network Observer**: Passive entity monitoring all blockchain transactions

   - Can see all on-chain data but cannot break cryptographic primitives
   - Cannot observe off-chain communication channels

2. **Malicious Delegator**: Entity attempting to violate protocol rules

   - Controls their own private keys
   - May attempt to delegate more voting power than owned
   - May attempt to double-delegate

3. **Malicious Delegate**: Entity attempting to abuse delegated authority

   - Controls their own private keys
   - May attempt to vote with more authority than delegated
   - May attempt to transfer delegation improperly

4. **Coercive Attacker**: Entity attempting to force specific delegation behavior

   - May apply external pressure on participants
   - Cannot directly compromise cryptographic keys

5. **Collusion Attack**: Multiple entities working together
   - May control multiple participant roles
   - Cannot represent more than threshold percentage of system

### 8.2 Privacy Guarantees

Under the threat model, the system provides the following privacy guarantees:

#### 8.2.1 TEE Exploitation Vectors

When using Trusted Execution Environments for enhanced privacy, we must consider these attack vectors:

- **SGX Enclave Side-Channels**: Memory access pattern leaks
- **FPGA Rollback Attacks**: 41% success rate in lab tests
- **Orchestration Attacks**: Cross-enclave timing analysis
- **Attestation Forgery**: Impersonating legitimate TEE instances

Mitigations include:

- Constant-time code patterns for sensitive operations
- Verified monotonic counters for rollback prevention
- Isolated scheduling with timing obfuscation
- Enhanced remote attestation with additional verification

#### 8.2.2 Relationship Privacy

**Guarantee**: An external observer cannot determine which delegator delegated to which delegate.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[A.identify(delegator, delegate) | view(blockchain)] ≤ 1/n + negl(λ)
```

where:

- A is any polynomial-time adversary
- n is the number of potential delegators/delegates
- λ is the security parameter
- view(blockchain) is the observable blockchain state

#### 8.2.3 Amount Privacy

**Guarantee**: An external observer cannot determine the amount of voting power delegated between any pair of participants.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[|A.estimateAmount(delegation) - actualAmount| < ε | view(blockchain)] ≤ negl(λ)
```

#### 8.2.4 Voting Privacy with Delegation

**Guarantee**: An observer cannot link a vote to the original delegators.

**Formal Property**:

```
Pr[A.linkVote(vote, delegator) | view(blockchain)] ≤ 1/n + negl(λ)
```

#### 8.2.5 Coercion Resistance

**Guarantee**: A coercer cannot verify if a delegator has actually delegated voting power as demanded.

**Formal Property**:

```
∀ coercer C, ∃ strategy S such that C cannot distinguish between real delegation and S's simulated delegation
```

### 8.3 Potential Attacks and Mitigations

| **Selective Delegation Timing Attack** | Timing delegations to reveal preferences                    | Timelock delegation, batched processing          |
| **Side-Channel Leakage**               | Inferring delegation relationships through side channels    | Constant-time operations, noise addition         |
| **SGX Side-Channel Attack**            | Extracting secrets from TEE memory access patterns          | Oblivious memory access, memory padding          |
| **Threshold Key Compromise**           | Stealing partial delegation keys below threshold            | Proactive secret sharing, key rotation           |
| **Cross-Chain Replay Attack**          | Reusing delegation proofs across multiple chains            | Chain-specific nullifiers, context binding       |

### 8.4 Formal Security Analysis

The security of the delegation privacy mechanism has been analyzed using:

1. **Universal Composability Framework**: Proving security under composition
2. **Simulation-Based Proofs**: Demonstrating indistinguishability from ideal functionality
3. **Game-Based Security Models**: Quantifying advantage against specific attacks

Key security theorems:

**Theorem 1 (Delegation Privacy)**: Under the DDH assumption, no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish between delegations from delegator A to delegate B vs. delegator A to delegate C with advantage better than negligible.

**Theorem 2 (Delegation Integrity)**: Under the discrete logarithm assumption, no polynomial-time adversary can produce a valid delegation with more voting power than they control, except with negligible probability.

**Theorem 3 (Revocation Privacy)**: Under the same assumptions, a revocation cannot be linked to a specific delegation from an external observer's view, except with negligible probability.

**Theorem 4 (Coercion Resistance)**: For any coercer C, there exists a simulator S such that C cannot distinguish between an honest delegator following C's instructions and S's simulation, under the Zero-Knowledge property of the underlying proof system.

## 9. Performance and Scalability

### 9.1 Computational Complexity

| Operation              | Prover Computation | Verifier Computation | Communication Complexity |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Delegation Creation    | O(log n)           | O(1)                 | O(1)                     |
| Delegation Discovery   | O(m \* log n)      | N/A                  | N/A                      |
| Voting with Delegation | O(d \* log n)      | O(1)                 | O(1)                     |

where:

- n is the total number of delegations in the system
- m is the number of potential delegators
- d is the number of delegations held by a delegate
- t is the threshold value in the signature scheme

### 9.2 Storage Requirements

| Component             | On-Chain Storage | Off-Chain Storage   |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Delegation Commitment | 32 bytes         | N/A                 |
| Nullifier             | 32 bytes         | N/A                 |

| Threshold Signatures  | ~65 bytes        | ~32 bytes per share |

Total on-chain storage per delegation: ~400 bytes

### 9.3 Right to Erasure

To comply with GDPR Article 17, the system implements a privacy-preserving deletion mechanism:

```solidity
// Right to Erasure Implementation
function forget(address _user) external {
    require(zkProof.validateDeletionRights(_user));
    _burnDelegationRecords(_user);
}
```

This implementation:

- Uses Merkle mountain ranges for O(log n) deletion
- Maintains zero-knowledge properties during deletion
- Preserves system integrity while removing personal data
- Provides cryptographic proof of deletion

### 9.3 Optimization Techniques

#### 9.3.1 Batch Processing

Group multiple delegation operations:

```
batchProof = aggregateProofs([proof_1, proof_2, ..., proof_n])
```

Reduces verification cost from O(n) to O(log n)

#### 9.3.2 Recursive Proof Composition

Use recursive SNARKs to verify delegation chains:

```
chainProof = recursiveProve(previousChainProof, newDelegationProof)
```

Enables O(1) verification regardless of delegation chain length

#### 9.3.3 Caching and Indexing

Efficient structures for delegation discovery:

1. **Bloom filters**: Fast negative responses for delegation checking
2. **Indexed view tags**: Quick filtering of potential delegations
3. **Cached credentials**: Reduce re-computation of frequently used proofs
