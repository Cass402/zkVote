## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the design of the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK-SNARK) circuits that form the cryptographic foundation of the zkVote protocol. These circuits enable privacy-preserving voting while ensuring verifiable correctness of all operations.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers the detailed design of all ZK-SNARK circuits required for the zkVote protocol, including:

- Voter eligibility verification circuits
- Private delegation circuits
- Vote casting circuits
- Vote tallying circuits
- Result verification circuits
- Recursive proof aggregation circuits
- Cross-chain verification circuits
- Post-quantum resistant circuits

### 1.3 Background

ZK-SNARKs enable a prover to convince a verifier that a computational statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of zkVote, these circuits allow voters to prove they are eligible to vote, have cast valid votes, and enable administrators to prove votes have been tallied correctlyâ€”all without revealing individual votes or compromising privacy.

### 1.4 Design Goals

The circuit design aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Ensure no information about individual votes is leaked
2. **Verifiable Correctness**: Enable cryptographic verification of voting processes
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Minimize circuit complexity and proof generation costs
4. **Composability**: Support modular combination of circuit components
5. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable verification across different blockchain environments
6. **Quantum Resistance**: Provide long-term security against quantum computing threats
7. **Performance Scalability**: Optimize for high-throughput proof generation and verification

## 2. Circuit Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The zkVote protocol employs a layered circuit architecture consisting of six primary circuit groups:

![ZKVote Circuit Architecture](https://placeholder.com/zkvote-circuit-architecture)

1. **Identity Circuit Layer**: Handles voter identity and eligibility verification
2. **Delegation Circuit Layer**: Manages privacy-preserving delegation operations
3. **Vote Processing Circuit Layer**: Processes individual vote casting operations
4. **Tallying Circuit Layer**: Aggregates votes while maintaining privacy
5. **Verification Circuit Layer**: Enables result verification without compromising vote privacy
6. **Recursive Aggregation Layer**: Enables efficient proof composition and verification

### 2.2 Modular Proof System Architecture

zkVote employs a modular zero-knowledge proof system architecture that allows for selecting the optimal proving system based on specific requirements:

| Proof System | Primary Use Case | Trust Model     | Constraints | Performance |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Groth16      | Vote casting     | Trusted setup   | Low         | High        |
| PLONK        | Delegation       | Universal SRS   | Medium      | Medium      |
| STARK        | Audit trails     | Transparent     | High        | Low         |
| Plonky2      | Recursive proofs | Universal + FRI | Low-Medium  | High        |
| Artemis      | ML verification  | Transparent     | Medium      | Medium-High |
| HyperNova    | Aggregation      | Folding scheme  | Medium      | High        |

The selection of proof system is determined by:

1. **Security Requirements**: Level of trust assumptions acceptable
2. **Performance Constraints**: Proof generation and verification time requirements
3. **Storage Limitations**: Proof size and verification key size constraints
4. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Verification requirements across different platforms

### 2.3 Circuit Interaction Model

The circuits interact through a carefully designed input/output pattern that preserves zero-knowledge properties while enabling composability:

```

                             +---------------+
                             | Configuration |

                             +-------+-------+
                                     |
                                     v

3. Universal verification circuits compatible with multiple EVM environments

### 2.4 Cross-Circuit Constraints

To maintain integrity across the circuit pipeline, we employ the following techniques:

1. **Nullifier-based Linking**: Cryptographic commitments that link circuit outputs without revealing sensitive data
2. **Verifiable Encryption**: Enabling encrypted outputs from one circuit to be used as inputs to another
3. **Merkle Inclusion Proofs**: Verifying inclusion of credentials/votes in global state without revealing specifics
4. **Recursive Composition**: Verifying the correctness of previously generated proofs within new circuits

- $C(x, r)$ = $g^x \cdot h^r$: Pedersen commitment to $x$ using randomness $r$
- $\pi_x$: Zero-knowledge proof for statement $x$

### 4.1.3 Post-Quantum Circuit Extensions

To ensure long-term security against quantum adversaries, the following post-quantum constructs are implemented:

- **Dilithium Signature Verification**: $\text{Verify}_{\text{Dilithium}}(\sigma, pk, m) = 1$

- **Isogeny-Based Encryption**: For vote encryption with post-quantum security

Key parameters:

- Dilithium-3: 2.3KB signatures, 128-bit post-quantum security level
- Kyber-1024: 2.4KB ciphertexts, 192-bit post-quantum security level

### 4.2 Identity and Eligibility Circuit Formulation

The identity circuit must validate that a voter with private key $sk$ corresponding to public key $pk = g^{sk}$ has eligibility credentials $cred$ that satisfy the eligibility policy $P$, and computes a nullifier $N$ that prevents double-voting.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Public key derivation:

   - Verify $pk = g^{sk}$

2. Credential validation with Merkle proof:

   - Verify $MerkleProof(cred, MerkleRoot_{eligibility})$

3. Eligibility policy satisfaction:

   - Verify $P(cred) = 1$

4. Nullifier computation:

   - $N = H(sk || voteId)$

5. Voting weight computation:
   - $weight = W(cred)$
   - $weightCommitment = C(weight, r_{weight})$

### 4.3 Delegation Circuit Formulation

The delegation circuit must verify that a delegator with voting weight $weight_{delegator}$ can transfer authority to a delegate with public key $pk_{delegate}$ while preserving privacy.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Delegator authorization:

   - Verify $\pi_{eligibility}$ is valid for delegator

2. Delegation commitment:

   - $delegationCommitment = H(pk_{delegator} || pk_{delegate} || weight || constraints)$

3. Updated weight commitments:

   - $weightCommitment_{delegator}' = C(weight_{delegator} - weight, r_{delegator}')$
   - $weightCommitment_{delegate}' = C(weight_{delegate} + weight, r_{delegate}')$

4. Delegation nullifier:
   - $N_{delegation} = H(sk_{delegator} || pk_{delegate} || voteId)$

### 4.4 Vote Casting Circuit Formulation

The vote casting circuit must verify that a voter casts a valid vote according to the voting rules.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Voter authorization:

   - Verify $\pi_{eligibility}$ or $\pi_{delegation}$ is valid

2. Vote choice validation:

   - Verify $choice \in ValidOptions$
   - For ranked choice: verify $\forall i,j: i \neq j \implies choice_i \neq choice_j$
   - For quadratic voting: verify $\sum{voteWeight_i^2} \leq totalWeight$

3. Encrypted vote computation:

   - $encryptedVote = E(choice || weight, r_{vote})$
   - $voteCommitment = C(H(choice || weight), r_{commitment})$

4. Vote nullifier:
   - $N_{vote} = H(sk || voteId)$ or $H(N_{delegation} || voteId)$

### 4.5 Tallying Circuit Formulation

The tallying circuit must aggregate votes correctly while preserving privacy.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Vote inclusion verification:

   - For each vote, verify $MerkleProof(voteCommitment, MerkleRoot_{votes})$

2. Vote decryption (if applicable):

   - $choice_i || weight_i = D(encryptedVote_i, key_{tally})$

3. Result aggregation:

   - For each option $j$: $result_j = \sum{weight_i \cdot [choice_i = j]}$
   - Final results: $results = \{result_1, result_2, ..., result_m\}$

4. Result commitment:
   - $resultCommitment = C(H(results), r_{result})$

### 4.6 Recursive Proof Formulation

The recursive aggregation circuit enables efficient verification of multiple proofs through a single verification.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Verification of individual proofs:

   - For each proof $\pi_i$, verify $Verify(vk_i, \pi_i, x_i) = 1$

2. Recursive SNARK verification:

   - Create a proof $\pi_{recursive}$ that proves knowledge of valid proofs $\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n$
   - $Verify(vk_{recursive}, \pi_{recursive}, x_{aggregated}) = 1$

3. Folding-based optimization:

   - For proofs $\pi_1, \pi_2$, compute $\pi_{fold} = Fold(\pi_1, \pi_2)$
   - Continue folding: $\pi_{final} = Fold(...Fold(Fold(\pi_1, \pi_2), \pi_3)..., \pi_n)$

4. Final proof size reduction:
   - $||\pi_{final}|| \ll \sum_{i=1}^{n} ||\pi_i||$

### 5.6 Circuit Composition and Optimization

To optimize the zkVote circuits, we employ several techniques:

1. **Circuit Factorization**: Decomposing complex constraints into reusable components
2. **Custom Gate Design**: Implementing specialized gates for common operations
3. **Lookup Tables**: Using lookup tables for non-linear operations where possible
4. **Witness Generation Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for witness computation
5. **Parallel Computation**: Structuring circuits to leverage parallel proving
6. **Split Memory Optimization**: Reducing memory overhead through hash-based circuit partitioning
7. **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-optimized MSM implementations and FPGA acceleration

#### 5.6.1 Split Circuit Optimization

Split methodology reduces memory overhead by 50-73% through hash-based circuit partitioning:

```rust
// Split circuit into sequential components
let (circuit1, circuit2) = split_circuit(original_circuit, partition_point);
generate_hash_constraint(circuit1, circuit2);
```

Key improvements:

- Reduces peak memory usage from 32GB to 8.7GB for 300k-iteration loops
- Maintains security through Poseidon hash constraints between partitions
- Enables processing of circuits 3.8x larger on commodity hardware

#### 5.6.2 Yoimiya Automated Partitioning

Yoimiya's constraint dependency graph (CDG) analysis for optimal circuit splitting:

$$\text{PartitionScore} = \frac{\text{MemReduction}}{\text{HashOverhead} + \text{ParallelizationCost}}$$

Implementation benefits:

- 41% faster witness generation through pipeline parallelism
- Dynamic resource allocation based on circuit complexity profiles
- 12.6x throughput improvement for batched proofs

## 6. Security Analysis

### 6.1 Security Properties

The zkVote circuit design ensures the following security properties:

1. **Vote Privacy**: Individual votes remain confidential

   - Protected by: Zero-knowledge proofs, encryption, commitment schemes
