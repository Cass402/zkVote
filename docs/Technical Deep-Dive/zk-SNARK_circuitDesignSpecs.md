## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the design of the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK-SNARK) circuits that form the cryptographic foundation of the zkVote protocol. These circuits enable privacy-preserving voting while ensuring verifiable correctness of all operations.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers the detailed design of all ZK-SNARK circuits required for the zkVote protocol, including:

- Voter eligibility verification circuits
- Private delegation circuits
- Vote casting circuits
- Vote tallying circuits
- Result verification circuits

### 1.3 Background

ZK-SNARKs enable a prover to convince a verifier that a computational statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of zkVote, these circuits allow voters to prove they are eligible to vote, have cast valid votes, and enable administrators to prove votes have been tallied correctlyâ€”all without revealing individual votes or compromising privacy.

### 1.4 Design Goals

The circuit design aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Ensure no information about individual votes is leaked
2. **Verifiable Correctness**: Enable cryptographic verification of voting processes
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Minimize circuit complexity and proof generation costs
4. **Composability**: Support modular combination of circuit components
5. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable verification across different blockchain environments

## 2. Circuit Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The zkVote protocol employs a layered circuit architecture consisting of five primary circuit groups:

![ZKVote Circuit Architecture](https://placeholder.com/zkvote-circuit-architecture)

1. **Identity Circuit Layer**: Handles voter identity and eligibility verification
2. **Delegation Circuit Layer**: Manages privacy-preserving delegation operations
3. **Vote Processing Circuit Layer**: Processes individual vote casting operations
4. **Tallying Circuit Layer**: Aggregates votes while maintaining privacy
5. **Verification Circuit Layer**: Enables result verification without compromising vote privacy

### 2.2 Circuit Interaction Model

The circuits interact through a carefully designed input/output pattern that preserves zero-knowledge properties while enabling composability:

### 2.3 Cross-Circuit Constraints

To maintain integrity across the circuit pipeline, we employ the following techniques:

2. **Verifiable Encryption**: Enabling encrypted outputs from one circuit to be used as inputs to another
3. **Merkle Inclusion Proofs**: Verifying inclusion of credentials/votes in global state without revealing specifics

## 4. Mathematical Formulation

### 4.1 Notation and Preliminaries

We use the following notation throughout this document:

- $G$: Cyclic group of prime order $p$
- $g$: Generator of group $G$
- $H(x)$: Cryptographic hash function (specifically, Poseidon for in-circuit efficiency)
- $E(m, r)$: Encryption of message $m$ with randomness $r$
- $C(x, r)$ = $g^x \cdot h^r$: Pedersen commitment to $x$ using randomness $r$
- $\pi_x$: Zero-knowledge proof for statement $x$

### 4.2 Identity and Eligibility Circuit Formulation

The identity circuit must validate that a voter with private key $sk$ corresponding to public key $pk = g^{sk}$ has eligibility credentials $cred$ that satisfy the eligibility policy $P$, and computes a nullifier $N$ that prevents double-voting.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Public key derivation:

   - Verify $pk = g^{sk}$

2. Credential validation with Merkle proof:

   - Verify $MerkleProof(cred, MerkleRoot_{eligibility})$

3. Eligibility policy satisfaction:

   - Verify $P(cred) = 1$

4. Nullifier computation:

   - $N = H(sk || voteId)$

5. Voting weight computation:
   - $weight = W(cred)$
   - $weightCommitment = C(weight, r_{weight})$

### 4.3 Delegation Circuit Formulation

The delegation circuit must verify that a delegator with voting weight $weight_{delegator}$ can transfer authority to a delegate with public key $pk_{delegate}$ while preserving privacy.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Delegator authorization:

   - Verify $\pi_{eligibility}$ is valid for delegator

2. Delegation commitment:

   - $delegationCommitment = H(pk_{delegator} || pk_{delegate} || weight || constraints)$

3. Updated weight commitments:

   - $weightCommitment_{delegator}' = C(weight_{delegator} - weight, r_{delegator}')$
   - $weightCommitment_{delegate}' = C(weight_{delegate} + weight, r_{delegate}')$

4. Delegation nullifier:
   - $N_{delegation} = H(sk_{delegator} || pk_{delegate} || voteId)$

### 4.4 Vote Casting Circuit Formulation

The vote casting circuit must verify that a voter casts a valid vote according to the voting rules.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Voter authorization:

   - Verify $\pi_{eligibility}$ or $\pi_{delegation}$ is valid

2. Vote choice validation:

   - Verify $choice \in ValidOptions$
   - For ranked choice: verify $\forall i,j: i \neq j \implies choice_i \neq choice_j$
   - For quadratic voting: verify $\sum{voteWeight_i^2} \leq totalWeight$

3. Encrypted vote computation:

   - $encryptedVote = E(choice || weight, r_{vote})$
   - $voteCommitment = C(H(choice || weight), r_{commitment})$

4. Vote nullifier:
   - $N_{vote} = H(sk || voteId)$ or $H(N_{delegation} || voteId)$

### 4.5 Tallying Circuit Formulation

The tallying circuit must aggregate votes correctly while preserving privacy.

**Mathematical Constraints:**

1. Vote inclusion verification:

   - For each vote, verify $MerkleProof(voteCommitment, MerkleRoot_{votes})$

2. Vote decryption (if applicable):

   - $choice_i || weight_i = D(encryptedVote_i, key_{tally})$

3. Result aggregation:

   - For each option $j$: $result_j = \sum{weight_i \cdot [choice_i = j]}$
   - Final results: $results = \{result_1, result_2, ..., result_m\}$

4. Result commitment:
   - $resultCommitment = C(H(results), r_{result})$
